      "Importing the plugins from our www repo is not enough to fix this. \r\nWe need to create a _config.yml file to let jekyll know to use pygments and not maruku (maruku current fails to parse sone files).\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky you had a branch where users could build the docs right? Was it missing a lot of things?\r\nWe should try to release it.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, what we need is at least:\r\n- tell jekyll to use pygments with a _config.yml file\r\n- create a _includes directory with the appropriate content\r\n- import some plugins from the www repo\r\n\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky we should probably open another issue for that."
