        "Currently in the API pages the \"Command syntax\" labels the options only as `options`. This is probably a space-saving means for the main page, and that makes sense there. But I would rather see the options spelled out (including the defaults), as they are in the Python docs. For example I would like to see the [`connect` Python page](http://rethinkdb.com/api/python/connect/) go from:\r\n```\r\nr.connect(options) \8594 connection\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\nr.connect(host='localhost', port=28015, db='test', user='admin', password='', timeout=20, ssl=None) \8594 connection\r\n```"
