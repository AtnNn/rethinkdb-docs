      "A few more:\r\n* the `getField` type signatures use the bracket term `sequence(attr)` instead of `sequence.getField(attr)`. These are now slightly different terms.\r\n* `toJsonString, toJSON` example uses inconsistent capitalization: `toJson`.\r\n* `insert`, `update` and `replace` refer to `json` in their type signatures. It should probably say `object`.\r\n* The batch `insert` signature is ambiguously written as `[json]`. We use square brackets elsewhere to mark optional arguments, so I think it should be `[object1, object2, ...]` instead to make clear that it's an array of multiple documents."
