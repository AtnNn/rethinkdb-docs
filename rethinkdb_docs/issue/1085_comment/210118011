      "Yep, that's the problem -- we have a custom `{% apibody %}` Jekyll tag we use in the API pages that _does_ handle HTML entities, but that block isn't styled correctly when I use it here. I'll just stick to the code block but use the actual Unicode character \"\8594\" there. (It's not the first place in the docs there's a Unicode character rather than an entity code, so there's precedence...)"
