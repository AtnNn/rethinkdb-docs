        "How to reproduce this issue:\r\n\r\n0. Make a database called `db` and make a table inside of it called `table`\r\n1. Run `r.db('db').table('table').insert({x: r.now(), y: {z: r.now()}})`, wait a couple seconds, and then run the exact same command again.\r\n2. Run `r.db('db').table('table').orderBy(r.desc('x'))` and then `r.db('db').table('table').orderBy(r.asc('x'))` and notice how the results of those two queries are different (as they should be - one is using r.desc and the other is using r.asc)\r\n3. Run `r.db('db').table('table').orderBy(r.desc('y.z'))` and then `r.db('db').table('table').orderBy(r.asc('y.z'))` and notice how the results of those two queries are **the same**, when they should be different (because one is using r.desc and the other is using r.asc)\r\n\r\nThat^ process demonstrate that parent elements (e.g. `x`) work with `.orderBy` but child elements (e.g. `z` from the parent element `y`) don't work with `.orderBy`. I'm just using this terminology of \"parent elements\" and \"child elements\" because I don't know the real name for them, so I apologize for any confusion.\r\n\r\nP.S. I've also tried using `r.db('db').table('table').pluck('y').orderBy(r.asc('z'))` and even `r.db('db').table('table').pluck('y').orderBy(r.asc('y.z'))` and neither of those work either."
