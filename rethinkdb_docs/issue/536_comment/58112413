      "There are two proposals at the moment, the first of which is rethinkdb/rethinkdb#3148 to add the `step` optarg to `r.range()`. This is fairly trivial for integers thus I'll probably end up adding that soon.\r\n\r\nThe second, rethinkdb/rethinkdb#3149, is to add support for more types, particularly dates and floating point numbers. It's more involved and will require some discussion, thus that'll probably take some more time."
