        "In the `eqJoin` example of the compound index section of http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/secondary-indexes/javascript/#compound-indexes we use a field called \"author_full_name\" in the \"posts\" table.\r\n\r\nFor someone who isn't familiar with how `eqJoin` works, it might not be clear that \"author_full_name\" is just the name of a field. A user on Slack assumed that it was the name of a second compound index for example, and was wondering what that index was containing.\r\n\r\nWe should explain above the example that the documents in the `posts` table have a field called `author_full_name` and that we assume that it contains the names of the posts' authors in the form `[last_name, first_name]`."
