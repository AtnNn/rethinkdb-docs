      "@mlucy -- agreed, @coffeemug and I discussed this and felt that the two most common return types were basically JSON and a cursor, except that the output of using `profile` isn't valid JSON since it contains a cursor as part of the return value.\r\n\r\n`object` seemed like the best fit. What is your suggestion on how to advertise the return type in the signature?\r\n\r\n"
