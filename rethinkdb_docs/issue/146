        "Request for recipe:\r\n> I'd like to see some recipes about different ways to use the cursor returned by a RQL query that has multiple results (like filter), preferably with some notes about performance. I was previously just looping ('for doc in cursor: do stuff'). However, I saw in one of the example projects that you can convert the cursor to a list with list(). I didn't realise that was possible previously and wonder what other ways people deal with the cursor and whether there are any performance reasons for doing it one way on another.\r\n\r\n\r\nJavaScript has some docs about cursors in the API page (because of the methods `next`, `hasNext` etc.), but Python does not.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we should add a recipe, or a whole page on cursor.\r\nMaybe we can write about that with https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/40"
