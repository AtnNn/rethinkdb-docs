      "I still think we need a page on resource requirements, but for a different reason now. Before people had to specify memory limits manually which was terrible. Now that this problem is gone, people still wonder -- how much disk space do things take, how much RAM overheard, etc. I think it would make a lot of difference if we had an honest page describing these overheads to people and may be some best practices. I can open another issue for it and close this one if you'd like, but I think this basically captures what we need."
