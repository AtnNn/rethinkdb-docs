      "Hi,\r\nI am new to RethinkDB and recently started to explore it. I used the ten-minute guide and after I installed the client driver, I must say, I missed on starting the server before connecting with a driver(May be that's just me). I know a few other people just trying to explore RethinkDB who missed on starting the server. Just thought of sharing my experience,here, after seeing this issue."
