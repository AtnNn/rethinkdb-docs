      "Sorry, I guess I misinformed you. In 1.16 or 2.0, if a shard's primary is permanently removed, the shard will not have any primary until the user sets the primary with `reconfigure()` or by writing to `table_config`.\r\n\r\nThis might not be worth fixing because the behavior will change again in 2.1."
