        "Hello!\r\n\r\nIn the 'limitations of RethinkDB' in FAQ there is:\r\n\r\n> There is no hard limit on the number of tables per database or cluster. However, performance degrades based on the total number of shards across all tables on a cluster. The current recommendation is to keep this number below 300 (i.e., 300 tables with one shard each, or 50 tables with six shards each).\r\n\r\nDoes it mean that I shouldn't have more than 300 tables on one database server or is it somehow counted differently? I've tried googling, but the only reference to it is from long time ago and mentions that it might be fixed. What the current status of this limitation?\r\n\r\nThanks,"
