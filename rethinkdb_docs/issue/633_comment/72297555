      "I think we should probably make a temporary \"fix\" for this, given that it's not exactly incorrect but kind of mangled. How about replacing that FAQ answer with something more like:\r\n\r\n> Most write operations involving a single document in RethinkDB are guaranteed to atomic. Operations that are not deterministic cannot update documents in an atomic fashion (such as random values, or values obtained as the result of a subquery). In addition, multiple documents are not updated atomically.\r\n\r\nThis uses language much closer to the architecture document."
