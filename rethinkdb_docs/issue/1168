        "- [x] I have read and agreed to the RethinkDB Contributor License Agreement http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe current indentation on function serialization makes it look as if `[ADD ...]` belongs to `MAKE_ARRAY` as opposed to belonging to `FUNC`. This change de-indents it by one space to make it clearer."
