      "The image for \"Importing your data\" makes the syntax string for the import command wrap in a very uncomfortable manner.\r\n\r\n@chipotle, could we add an intro paragraph that defines what kind of data formats you can import in a friendly manner, and when it would be useful to import your data into RethinkDB? It's a bit perfunctory, but it will help us wrap the image cleanly (and make the article a tad friendlier).\r\n\r\nAssigning to @chipotle until this portion is done."
