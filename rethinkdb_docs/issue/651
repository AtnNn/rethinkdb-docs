        "@knownasilya ran into the error message \"Expected type DATUM but found SELECTION\" while doing a join with `merge` (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3774). The reason for the error was that he was missing a `coerceTo('ARRAY')` inside the merge function.\r\n\r\nWe already have an example in the API docs for `merge` http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/merge/ that uses `coerceTo('ARRAY')`\r\n> Example: Use merge to join each blog post with its comments.\r\n\r\nI think we should add a note that says something along the lines of 'Note: Getting \"Expected type DATUM but found SELECTION\" when trying to join two tables with `merge`? You might have to use `coerceTo(\"ARRAY\")` inside the merge function. See the above code for an example.'\r\n"
