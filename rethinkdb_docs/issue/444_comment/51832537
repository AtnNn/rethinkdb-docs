      "I should add that because of rethinkdb/rethinkdb#2791 `index_status` and `index_wait` now also return `multi` and `outdated` (both bools), corresponding to the `multi` optarg when the index was created, and whether the index is outdated in the current version of rethinkdb (respectively).\r\n\r\nYour understanding of this looks correct to me.  To answer your questions:\r\n\r\nUse cases:\r\n* You can export your secondary indexes alongside your data (for backup purposes), and restore them later.\r\n* You can create a new index on another table using the same function without knowing what the code is\r\n* This allows the rebuilding of outdated indexes with a fairly simple script\r\n\r\n`index_status` should return the `function`, `multi`, and `outdated` fields even if the index is not ready."
