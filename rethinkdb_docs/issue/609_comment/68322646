      "I think it should also state that it is not allowed to use normal expression logic (as it cannot be serialized I guess). And maybe it should talk about boolean shortcut evaluation as well as grouping some more. I had a hard time to figure out (to write above SO answer) if `get(\"a\").hasField().not().or get(\"a\").eq(\"xx\")`   would somehow be allowed."
