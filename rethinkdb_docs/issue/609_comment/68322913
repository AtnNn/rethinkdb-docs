      "@ecki Thanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\nThe inability to use operators for comparison and boolean operations is actually a JavaScript specific limitation, though for Ruby and Python we still have to require `|` / `&` instead of the usual '||' / '&&' due to language limitations.\r\nIt's probably a good idea to note this as part of the `filter` documentation, since that's the context within which most people will use boolean expressions in ReQL."
