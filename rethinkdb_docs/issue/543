The documentation says `1M` which may be misleading.\r\n* The default for `max_batch_seconds` is 0.5\r\n* The default for `first_batch_scaledown_factor` is 4\r\n\r\nThe JavaScript driver does not currently accept these arguments at all. See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3161\r\n\r\nThe server silently accepts global optargs that it doesn't know about. See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2052"
