        "Since the official Java driver is almost complete, we need to start documenting it.\r\n\r\nI'm initially assigning this to @deontologician just for comments and notes on how to go about it. My suspicion is that the best thing to do will be to copy the documentation from one of the existing drivers -- probably JavaScript, just because it uses camelCase for commands already -- into a new folder and then work from there."
