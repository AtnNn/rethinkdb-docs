        "Fix for #203 \r\n\r\nI forgot that we have a template for switching language (I somehow thought it was just for the API docs).\r\nThis commit add the secondary indexes pages for javascript and ruby.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll open issues later to translate other articles later. The one for dates is especially tricky to do -- but also really useful I think.\r\n@mglukhovsky -- could you take a look at this?"
