      "If a shard is missing all of its replicas and then `unsafe_rollback_or_erase` is specified, then an arbitrary living replica will be chosen from a different shard, and the broken shard will be moved to that replica; and yes, just that single one.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose shard 1 has replicas on machines `A` and `B`, and shard 2 has replicas on machines `C` and `D`. Now machines `A` and `B` disconnect, and the user runs `unsafe_rollback_and_erase`. Shard 1 will become empty and it will be hosted on `C` or `D` (but not both), while shard 2 will stay the way it is."
