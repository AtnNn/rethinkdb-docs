      "It seems reasonable. The big caveat is the API docs, as you mentioned -- it *would* make the source document complex, but at the same time that's where this might be the most helpful, since the API docs are nearly-identical text with language-specific examples. Although I would probably add a ``{{#cc \"camelCase\" }}`` tag or something similar that outputs `camelCase` or `camel_case` depending on the language chosen, because doing that in text with a series of conditionals would get very verbose very quickly."
