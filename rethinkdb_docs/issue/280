        "The current API docs for `slice` are bad for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- We say that `endIndex` is optional, but don't have an example for it\r\n- The command has `leftBound` and `rightBound` arguments, but they're not mentioned in the command header and there are no examples for it\r\n- In python and ruby we use the `[]` label to denote the command in the bar on the left (and it also conflicts with `nth`). We should just call it `slice` everywhere, and add information to the ruby and python docs that users can use `[]` as an alias."
