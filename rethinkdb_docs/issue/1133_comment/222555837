      "Hi @dszymczuk, thanks for the suggestion.\r\nThis is the issue tracker for RethinkDB documentation. Would you mind opening the issue in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues ?\r\n\r\nPersonally I think that this would be a bad idea, because it would feel inconsistent. It makes logical sense that `limit(0)` returns zero rows. It just matches the invariant of `limit` that whichever number you give it, it returns at most that many rows.\r\nIt seems to me that you're using `0` as a special value in your code to indicate no limit at all, but this isn't necessarily true in general. Other people might use `-1`, or `null` for example.\r\nI think having `limit(null)` to indicate no limit at all might make sense.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this because it's the wrong issue tracker, but we can carry on at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues if you like to."
