      "The logstash filter has to do a bit of work to translate `new_val: null` from a changefeed into `action: \"delete\"`([see here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-action)) when it's passed to the elasticsearch plugin. Since logstash isn't specific to exporting from RethinkDB to ElasticSearch, the interface is more general.  My config above is a start at getting this working, using hidden variables that won't be persisted in the document sent to elasticsearch. \r\n\r\nOne thing that will make writing the filter less painful is rethinkdb/rethinkdb#5188, which makes it more direct to translate a change type into an elasticsearch-output action"
