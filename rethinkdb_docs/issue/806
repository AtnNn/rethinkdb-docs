        "RethinkDB keeps some data structures in RAM that are proportional in size to the data on disk. I think it's about 1% depending on the details of the user's dataset. (@danielmewes has better numbers.) We should mention this on the limitations page.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `docs/architecture` page claims that \"RethinkDB can operate on terabytes of data with only a few megabytes of cache space\", which is wrong. We would need tens of gigabytes of RAM to operate on terabytes of disk data."
