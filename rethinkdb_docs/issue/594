        "Moved to here from https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3378\r\n\r\n@nitipit wrote:\r\n\r\n-----\r\nIn http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guide/python/\r\nI think it should add information about using `repl() `\r\n> The reason for not using `repl()` is that if you call `connect()` from multiple threads, you can end up with thread2 changing the global connection, and switch it for other threads. It's a really pernicious source of bugs, so we decided to take default global connections out. It also makes dealing with multiple connections significantly more error-prone, as it's easy to lose track of which connection is global.\r\n\r\nfrom this comment\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/846#issuecomment-18142168"
