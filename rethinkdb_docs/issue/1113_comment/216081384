      "Good catch -- although it turns out the typo is actually in api/python/math-and-logic/mod.md, where there's both the miscreant ` character you noticed and an extra blank line above it. (The index.md file is actually built by a script that looks at all the api/* documents, so if we don't fix the typo in the original file, it'll just come back the next time the script gets run.) You could add this to your pull request or I can catch it later.\r\n\r\nAlso, have you signed our CLA? (I'm not in a place I can easily check right now.)\r\n\r\nhttp://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/"
