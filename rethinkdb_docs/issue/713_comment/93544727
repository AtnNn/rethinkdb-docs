      "Ah ha. The new version of the site we released with 2.0 uses a different Markdown renderer, and in some places it's a little less forgiving than the previous one -- the bug here is that the \"```\" from the code block and the \"# Compile from Source #\" don't have a blank line between them. Thanks for catching that!"
