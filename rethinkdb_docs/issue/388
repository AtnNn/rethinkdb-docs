        "http://rethinkdb.com/docs/frameworks-and-libraries/\r\n\r\nThe following JS library descriptions are misleading as the official Javascript driver now supports promises natively:\r\n\r\n - rethinkdb-co (co is actually the library that \"Allows using ECMAScript 6 generators\", and it can consume promises, so this isn't really necessary)\r\n - rethinkdbdash (\"native promises\" is a feature of the official JS driver)\r\n - RQL Promise (same as above)\r\n\r\nJust my opinion, I think RQL Promise is the most egregious, the rest are really subjective.
