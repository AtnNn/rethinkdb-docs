      "> I'm not sure what the rationale is for having two signatures, one that takes an array and one that takes a sequence; according to the data type docs I can find (rethinkdb/rethinkdb#1337), an array is a kind of sequence, right?\r\n\r\nYeah, the current docs are bad.  We use \"sequence\" to mean \"array or stream\".\r\n"
