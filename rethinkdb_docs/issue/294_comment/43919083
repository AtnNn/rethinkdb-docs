      "A sequence can be a `table`, `selection`, `stream`, `array`. At least, this is the current definition I am using in the data explorer:\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/admin/static/coffee/dataexplorer.coffee#L318\r\n\r\nAnd `table.concat_map(function)` would not return a table.\r\n\r\nThe syntax you have in your branch now looks good to me\r\n```\r\nstream.concat_map(function) -> stream\r\narray.concat_map(function) -> array\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an issue for types that I wanted to do for quite some time but somehow never found time to do it. \r\n\r\n@chipotle -- do you want try to tacke this? I was planning to wait a few days for you to get a little more familiar with RethinkDB but if you want to give a try, you are welcome to do so :)\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/40\r\nI would be happy to help too."
