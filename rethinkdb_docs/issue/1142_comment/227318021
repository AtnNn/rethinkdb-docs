      "We could go ahead and just add the values `asyncio` and `gevent` to the http://rethinkdb.com/api/python/set_loop_type API document, without providing any real documentation on how to use the driver with these backends.\r\n\r\nIt's not ideal, but since @Tryneus is still heavily occupied with Horizon-related work, it might be a short improvement for the short term. Going to re-open this with this limited scope."
