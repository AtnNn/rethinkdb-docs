      "* The `rethinkdb.server_config` table now has a new field called `cache_size_mb`. Also, the behavior of the `--cache-size` command line flag has changed (it's now persisted across restarts). See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3166.\r\n\r\n* If the user forgets their auth key, the solution is to change it by writing to `rethinkdb.cluster_config` through the data explorer in the web UI. We should mention this in the documentation because it's not obvious that the web UI doesn't require an auth key."
