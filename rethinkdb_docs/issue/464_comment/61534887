      "reql_admin is going to ship with 1.16. By now the basics are pretty much laid out and a lot of it is working already. A few details are still uncertain and some parts of it not implemented yet.\r\n\r\nA good starting point would be https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/156\r\nWe also need documentation for the ReQL admin terms in the API docs.\r\nI'll try to compile a full list of the things we need to document."
