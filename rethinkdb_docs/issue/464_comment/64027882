      "The non-admin things (that I know about) are already in the `v1.16` doc branch and completed:\r\n\r\n* `r.range` - #536\r\n* point change feeds - #563 \r\n* change \"machine\" to \"server\" - #571 \r\n* multi-stream map - #561\r\n* change \"master\" to \"primary replica\" - #573 \r\n\r\nI have a current version of `next` built on my machine (current as of this morning, at least) but I'll need some quick documentation about a lot of the bullet points above other than the obvious ones (like `--machine-name` becoming `--server-name`). Are server tags functionally identical to datacenters so it's basically just changing the phrase in the documentation, or is it a more substantial change than that?\r\n"
