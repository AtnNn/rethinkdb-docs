        "@mbroadst forked Thinky and modified it to use json-schema specifications. His fork is available at https://github.com/mbroadst/thinkagain under the name thinkagain.\r\n\r\nWe should add it to the ORM list at http://rethinkdb.com/docs/frameworks-and-libraries/\r\n\r\n\r\n> The module is essentially a drop-in replacement for thinky, of course using json-schema instead of thinky's schema. This means:\r\n> ```\r\n> let Model = thinky.createModel('person', {\r\n>   id: String,\r\n>   str: String,\r\n>   num: Number\r\n> })\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> becomes:\r\n> ```\r\n> let Model = thinkagain.createModel('person', {\r\n>   type: 'object',\r\n>   properties: {\r\n>     id: { type: 'string' },\r\n>     str: { type: 'string' },\r\n>     num: { type: 'number' }\r\n>   }\r\n> });\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> There are also a few notable changes:\r\n>   - virtual fields are not implemented\r\n>   - validation is always asynchronous (i.e. Model.validate(), Document.validate() return promises)\r\n>   - all validation-specific options (`enforce_type`, `enforce_missing`, etc) have been removed, in favor of ajv's internal options.\r\n>   - Oh, also no documentation whatsoever presently (though for the most part thinky's documentation still holds true) :) This will obviously change in the future, pending interest in the project."
