I think the FAQ http://rethinkdb.com/faq/ are a good place for this.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, this is the data we transmit:\r\n* RethinkDB version\r\n* Number of servers in the cluster\r\n* The operating system (Linux or OS X) and architecture (32 or 64 bit)\r\n* Number of tables, heavily rounded to the order of magnitude, namely `2^(round(log_2(num_tables)))`\r\n"
