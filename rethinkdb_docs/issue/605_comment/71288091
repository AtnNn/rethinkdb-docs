      "@mlucy suggested a few days ago that we could put an example or note about changefeeds in the documents of the commands that you can apply `changes()` to.\r\n\r\nFor example we could add an example with `changes()` to the documentation of the `max` term, or to `get` (\"... You can also listen to changes on a document by opening a changefeed: r...get(...).changes()\").\r\n\r\nI don't think this is necessary before the 1.16 release though. We can extend the documentation in that respect later.\r\n\r\nI think apart from documenting the `squash` parameter, noting the now working combinations in the `changes()` docs is the only critical thing."
