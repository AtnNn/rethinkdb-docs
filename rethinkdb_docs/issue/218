        "I translated the docs for JavaScript and Python.\r\n\r\nThe code for the examples were in a \"command-line\" like style. \r\nWe can't have the same thing in JavaScript and because it's easier to compare docs if they have the same format, I changed the ruby docs to not use a \"command line\" style for code.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a few more things I think we should change but I tried to keep the changes to a minimum here.\r\nI would like to merge this thing first so:\r\n- I can take care of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2076\r\n- Iterate from there -- I'll open an issue for the things I think we should improve before releasing if possible\r\n\r\nPing @coffeemug -- could you take a quick look at this?"
