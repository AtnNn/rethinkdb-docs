      "Sorry, I just realized that we were generating `code` blocks, and not `pre` blocks. It was like if we had just single ticks everywhere.\r\n\r\n@AtnNn -- I went with your solution of adding 4 spaces for these blocks.\r\nI did try to use misaka, but the results were the same (it was not properly parsing the triple ticks).\r\nI opened https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/513 -- we should just eventually rewrite the script in ruby and use the exact same markdown parser as the website."
