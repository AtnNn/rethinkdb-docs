      "For reference, we use RedCarpet, which is based on the Sundown library, from which the triple-backtick syntax that GitHub Flavored Markdown uses (and we use as well).\r\n\r\nI believe I got the origin story of triple-backtick in Markdown processors correct. In any case, we can explore other Python-based Markdown processors, or add a Ruby script that will call RedCarpet."
