        "Regarding the `server_config` section of http://rethinkdb.com/docs/system-tables/ : \r\nThe documents in there have an additional field:\r\n```js\r\n  \"cache_size_mb\": \"auto\" \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt can either be `\"auto\"` or a number. If it's auto, the server will pick a suitable cache size on startup based on the available memory on the system. If it's a number, the server will use that cache size.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `server_status` also has a field by the same name\r\n```js\r\n\"cache_size_mb\": 1024\r\n```\r\nin contrast to `server_config`, the cache size field in `server_status` is always a number. If the field in `server_config` is set to a number, the field in `server_status` will usually mirror that value. If the former is set to `\"auto\"`, the latter will show the actual cache size that the server determined on startup."
