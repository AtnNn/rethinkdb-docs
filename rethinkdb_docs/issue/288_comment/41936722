      "Thanks, this will be very helpful for other users.\r\n\r\nI have some comments about this section:\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> cd rethinkdb\r\n> ./configure --without-tcmalloc --allow-fetch\r\n> nano external/v8_3.22.24.17/third_party/icu/make\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> In the make file, remove all the text -m32 that you can find in the first part of the document\r\n\r\n* `./configure` does not fetch anything. The `external/v8_3.22.24.17` can be fetched by adding a `make fetch-v8` step.\r\n* There is no file called `third_party/icu/make` in the v8 source. Did you mean to specify a different file?\r\n* Could it be replaced by a call to `sed -i`? That would be easier to use.\r\n\r\nCan you explain why that step was necessary? I would like to modify the rethinkdb build scripts so that this step is not required in future versions of rethinkdb.\r\n"
