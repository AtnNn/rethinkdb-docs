      "@thomasmodeneis Thank you for the great feedback.\r\n\r\nThe init script should actually do all of those things automatically, though I think it defaults to user `rethinkdb` if no other user is defined and depending on how you installed RethinkDB that might not exist.\r\n\r\nA few follow up questions:\r\n- Which Linux distribution are you using in your vagrant box?\r\n- How did you install RethinkDB?\r\n- If you only set the runuser and rungroup in the instance file to `vagrant` (in your case) but don't create any folders, what is the error message that you receive?\r\n\r\nThis could be a problem with our init script more than with the documentation"
