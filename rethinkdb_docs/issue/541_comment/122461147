      "Just as an update to those monitoring this, I do have an \"unofficial\" repository with a kind of Rube Goldberg-esque script that builds three docsets, one for each language. It requires you to install `pandoc` first and to have checked out the docs repository.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/chipotle/reql-dash-build\r\n\r\nWe'll see about moving this into an \"official\" repository down the road, but if you're interested in testing it, you can see if the script works. (You will probably get a couple warnings.)"
