      "There's a first pass at this at in the issue-541-dash-docs branch (2c4ff53141be595d8b5c3d72a238cd649e1a927b). Right now that creates a `_dash` top-level directory with the script and support files, and creates the docsets in a `build` directory under that.\r\n\r\nAlso, right now this requires Pandoc to be installed (it'll warn you if it isn't; it's in Homebrew) and zsh (which comes installed on OS X), although we can probably abstract out the zsh-specific bits. (I suspect that's only the filename munging.)"
