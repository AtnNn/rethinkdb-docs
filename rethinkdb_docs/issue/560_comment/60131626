      "We can add Shirts for Stories here, too -- it doesn't look like it's on the existing community page, so I missed it!\r\n\r\nRight now in the new update I actually just have a link to our Meetup group rather than trying to add an actual calendar. (I'll see if there's a way to embed upcoming events directly on the page using a Meetup widget, though.) We can add a note about \"if you'd like to host a meetup or give a lightning talk at one of our events, email events@rethinkdb.com\" to that section."
