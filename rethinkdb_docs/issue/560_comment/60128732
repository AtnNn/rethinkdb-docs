We'll also want to add _Shirts for Stories_ to this page, right? \r\n\r\nI'd change \"meetup calendar\" to \"event calendar\" and include conferences, podcasts, etc. with a sub section for those who want to host or speak at their own local meetup and a link to _steps to do this_ or to _email me_ (can we set up events@rethinkdb.com if it hasn't been already?)."
