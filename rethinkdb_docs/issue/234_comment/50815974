      "While the examples for group cited here no longer exist, they aren't following the conventions that we came up with for example formatting shortly after the group API docs were rewritten. So I'm changing their formatting to match that standard, and also changing the superheroes tutorial doc to match (which is largely changing \">>>\" to \">\" to denote user input)."
