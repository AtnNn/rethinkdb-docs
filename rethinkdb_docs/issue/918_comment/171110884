      "Is there any problem if the nodes join up in a line, instead of all joining the same instance?\r\n\r\nFor example, say we have 3 servers, A, B, and C. \r\n\r\nC comes up first, then B joins C, and finally A joins B. Each server has the same config (`--join A --join B --join C`), but the join chain of events is dependent on starting timing. \r\n\r\nDoes `A -> B -> C` instead of `A,B -> C` pose any problems?"
