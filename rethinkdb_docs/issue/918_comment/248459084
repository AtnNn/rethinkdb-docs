      "@goors: You don't need identical servers for this. As far as I know, that's the proper way to list multiple servers to join in the configuration file -- one of the engineers can chime in here if that's wrong, but the documentation does say `join=` can be specified multiple times.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I don't think that's likely to be the cause of your crashes if they're happening when servers disconnect. I would check the troubleshooting logs for more information, and consider bringing this up in the RethinkDB user Slack or Stack Overflow. If you don't get an answer there, consider opening a bug report in the main rethinkdb repository rather than the docs."
