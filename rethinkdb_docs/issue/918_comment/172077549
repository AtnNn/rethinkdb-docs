      "I was wondering more about the case:\r\n\r\n* `--join`` is specified once for each node in the cluster\r\n* much of the cluster comes up concurrently (like after a power outage)\r\n\r\nand if there were any potential races that would prevent a fully-connected cluster from forming. It seems pretty low risk, I'll admit."
