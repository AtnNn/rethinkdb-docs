        "A few nits in the current version:\r\n\r\n* `machine-name` is now `server-name`\r\n* We don't describe how to do server tags in config files\r\n* We don't explicitly describe the format and show an example (we have a `default.conf.sample`, but this should be discussed more prominently)\r\n* It may not be clear that every CLI option is available in a config file (that's true, right?)\r\n\r\nI'm still not sure whether this should be broken out into a separate \"config file\" doc page, but I'm leaning toward doing so; it would let us talk about the config file format in a bit more detail and simplify the \"Create a cluster on system startup\" document. Any thoughts?"
