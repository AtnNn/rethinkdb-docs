        "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI love RethinkDB and contribute some of thing such as RethinkDB ORM http://github.com/kureikain/epiphy, RethinkDB and FluentD https://github.com/kureikain/fluent-plugin-rethink and Relang http://github.com/kureikain/relang\r\n\r\nAll that being said that I'm in love with it. One year ago, I started to document it because I want to learn more about it. At first, I blog, ot one point I started to writing it in markdown, using pandoc to convert it into PDF then I switched to Leanpub.\r\n\r\nOne year later. I almost finish with it. Here is the result http://github.com/kureikain/simplyrethink\r\nI'm going to publish the book soon at http://leanpub.com/simplyrethinkdb next week.\r\nThe book is still WIP though.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if someone on RethinkDB team can help me to review it, or/and write a foreword for it. \r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n"
