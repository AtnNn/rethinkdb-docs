        "The new documentation on data types looks great.\r\n\r\nHowever I noticed that all it says about strings is \"Strings are Unicode strings\". That isn't quite true. Unicode is a character set, not an encoding.\r\n\r\nThe situation in RethinkDB seems to be:\r\n\r\n* RethinkDB strings can't contain the null character (which is a valid unicode character)\r\n* Some ReQL operations such as `match` assume that strings are UTF-8 encoded\r\n* Other operations such as `split` assume that they are arrays of bytes.\r\n* It is possible to insert strings that are not valid UTF-8"
