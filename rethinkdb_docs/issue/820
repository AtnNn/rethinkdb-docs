Maybe it should be an additional line since it doesn't work in combination with the other arguments?\r\n\r\nOn a different note: Below \"Specify emergencyRepair with one of two string options:\", should the values `unsafe_rollback` and `unsafe_rollback_or_erase` be written as strings (i.e. `\"unsafe_rollback\"`) maybe to make it more obvious that they are string values (I'm not sure how we do that elsewhere)?"
