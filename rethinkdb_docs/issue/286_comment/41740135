      "@neumino -- I made some improvements to the JavaScript version (both the index page and the detailed page). I think it's much better (barring our design/typography issues, which we'll fix separately in the redesign phase).\r\n\r\nWould you mind studying the changes and converting them to python and ruby?\r\n\r\nNote that I changed the wording, reordered and combined some examples, fixed some stylistic issues (e.g. 100.000 -> 100,000, spelling, etc.), simplified some code samples, and added an example.\r\n\r\n"
