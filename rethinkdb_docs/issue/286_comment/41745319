      "> It's really, really nice in interactive mode because you get to play with small datasets ad-hoc. Also some tables (e.g. US states) never grow past 100k elements. So I disagree with the fundamental assumption here, though I see what you're getting at.\r\n\r\nOh, I didn't think about things like \"US States\", that seems totally reasonable now.\r\nI'll put the new example, and start copying things from JS to Python/Ruby.\r\n\r\n"
