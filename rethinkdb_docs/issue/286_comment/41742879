      "@coffeemug -- Sorting without an index should never be done on a table, even if it is a small one. If the table somehow grows, it will end up breaking their app in production.\r\n\r\nThe example I was using was sorting an array inside a document, which always has less than 100k documents and therefore will never trigger the \"RqlRuntimeError: Array size limit\".\r\n\r\nAny object if I rever this example?\r\nAll the rest looks good (and better) to me.\r\n"
