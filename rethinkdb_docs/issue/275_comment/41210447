      "Specifically:\r\n* We don't want to support both `Time` and `DateTime` because there's only one time type on the server, and it would be confusing to insert a `DateTime` and get back a `Time` or vice-versa.\r\n* The solution is to use `to_time` and `to_datetime` to convert before inserting and after retrieving respectively."
