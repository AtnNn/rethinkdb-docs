      "One way to fix it would be to have a field in the pseudotype reserved for the drivers and opaque to the server (but also that's persisted by the server). This way the driver can store a flag and pick the right type. I'm not sure if we want to do this, but it sounds like a good idea to support it in pseudotypes in general."
