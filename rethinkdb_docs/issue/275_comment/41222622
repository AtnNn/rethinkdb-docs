      "> One way to fix it would be to have a field in the pseudotype reserved for the drivers and opaque to the server (but also that's persisted by the server). This way the driver can store a flag and pick the right type. I'm not sure if we want to do this, but it sounds like a good idea to support it in pseudotypes in general.\r\n\r\nI'm a little hesitant because of cross-language problems.  It would be really confusing if you get back one type from the server, except for rows that you inserted in the data explorer or something."
