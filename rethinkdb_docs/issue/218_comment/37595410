      "That's a fair question. For docs, there is typically just one reviewer and the diffs aren't that complicated, so it shortens turn-around time if the reviewer just merges it in (and deploys it if they really want to push it out quickly).\r\n\r\nI think proper etiquette in this case is: if there are multiple reviewers, the person who opened the pull request should merge it in and delete the branch."
