      "Since JavaScript doesn't block, if you write a query in a shell you get\r\n```\r\n> r.expr(1).run(conn, function(err, result) {\r\n    console.log(result) \r\n})\r\nundefined\r\n> 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich isn't really good (it prints the result -- `undefined` first, the print `>` for the next input, then print `1`).\r\n\r\nAlso if we are going to add promises with https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1395 I would rather not have people think that the promise will eventually become a result by itself.\r\n"
