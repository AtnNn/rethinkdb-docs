      "I think that since @neumino is currently the defacto maintainer of the docs *and* the Javascript driver, he should have the final say over style when there are disagreements.\r\n\r\nAs far as my own opinion, I like @neumino's style more, but I think the point is moot because both aren't great. As soon as we get a dedicated docs maintainer, I think we should add visual support/control for expanding/collapsing sample input and output in the browser. We have to do the best we can for now, but I don't think we should worry about it too much.\r\n\r\nAlso -- I approve the review. I've given it a cursory glance (I have a *really* long day tomorrow and have to get to bed, which is challenging enough). Depending on how detailed @mlucy's review is, perhaps one more person (@atnnn?) should look at it."
