      "@mglukhovsky since we plan on doing this in the future, do you want to list every single report under \"RethinkDB architecture\"? I was figuring we'd order most recent first in this new section. \r\n\r\nOr, if it lives under architecture, _only_ the most recent version is kept there, but one could find the older ones in the rethinkdb/performance-reports repo"
