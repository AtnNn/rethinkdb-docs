      "@cefn Good points, we need to be careful about how to phrase this.\r\n\r\nRethinkDB updates are always on a per-document granularity, so it will definitely rewrite the whole thing. This is kind of hard to do differently in a document database without any schema, so we haven't gotten around to it so far. The issue to follow for this functionality is https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5369 . For the time being, our recommendation is not to use embedded arrays that are too large if they will be frequently updated. Instead we recommend using a separate table and a join, as you would do with a relational database."
