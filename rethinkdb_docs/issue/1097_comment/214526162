      "This has definitely come up before, and I can see understand where the confusion comes from.\r\n\r\nSome commands are more prone to this confusion than others, especially `append`, `prepend`, `insertAt`, `deleteAt` and `changeAt` I think.\r\n\r\nCould we have a note on these commands that states that the commands only return the changed value, but don't write it back to the table unless used with `update` or `replace`?"
