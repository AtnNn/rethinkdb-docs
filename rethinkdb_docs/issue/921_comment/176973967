      "A difficulty with the non-voting replica backup strategy is that there's no easy way currently to make `rethinkdb dump` read from the non-voting replica, except for\r\n* isolating the non-voting replica from the remaining cluster (with a firewall, or maybe by restarting it with different `--bind` options?)\r\n* and then modifying the `rethinkdb dump` script to perform an outdated read"
