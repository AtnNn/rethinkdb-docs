      "Other things to provide during a crash:\r\n* The output of RethinkDB while it's starting up.\r\n* The backtrace from the crash, if any.\r\n* What you were doing at the time.\r\n  - Is it reproducible?  If so, how do you reproduce it?\r\n* What your cluster configuration is.\r\n* What machine you're running on, especially:\r\n  - How much memory it has.\r\n  - Whether or not it's virtualized.\r\n  - What file system you're using.\r\n  - Any strange configuration details.\r\n\r\nTo avoid info dumping, we should probably mention the big three things we need first (output of RethinkDB when it's started, backtrace from the crash, output of `uname -a`), and then mention the nice-to-haves."
