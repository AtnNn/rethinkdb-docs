      "Is there something left to do here?\r\n\r\nI think our generic build instructions are good enough for now and we wrote docs for the main distributions (except gentoo -- but I believe building rethinkdb is a piece of cake for gentoo users).\r\nThe configure scripts works quite well too. Last time I updated the instructions for all the distributions, it was quite easy to find missing dependencies.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/build/"
