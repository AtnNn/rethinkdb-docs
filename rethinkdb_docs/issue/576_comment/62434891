      "I've seen many questions from users asking how to use cursors and how to turn them into a list.\r\n\r\n> Python and Ruby have iterators built into the language, and streams are accessed through those native constructs\r\n\r\nCan we document this on the API page? Similar to JavaScript's `EventEmitter methods`, for Python we could say `Iterator methods` and give examples of `next(cursor)`, `list(cursor)` and `for row in cursor:`"
