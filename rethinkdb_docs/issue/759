        "Here we only list http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/changes/ `table` and `singleSelection` as possible left-hand side arguments to `changes`.\r\n\r\nThis is no longer adequate, since `changes` can also be called on `selection`s and on some `stream`s.\r\n\r\nI think the two types that we have to list are `stream.changes` and `singleSelection.changes`.\r\n\r\n@Slava noticed this because `changes` didn't show up as a suggestion in the Data Explorer after certain operations (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4214)."
