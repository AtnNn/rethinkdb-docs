        "I forked from @Yoeori branch and just updated a few things\r\n- remove two packages that are not available on Raspbian\r\n- I didn't have to tweak any Makefile. I got some warning like `/tmp/cc4TQG3W.s:5332: Warning: swp{b} use is deprecated for this architecture` but I just ignored them ^_^\r\n- Add instructions on how to create a swap/partition.\r\n\r\n@AtnNn -- Could you review this?\r\nI ran a few queries, and everything seemed to work (including `r.js`)\r\n\r\nAlso the build is on http://justonepixel.com/rethinkdb/raspbian/rethinkdb\r\nDo you want to push it on our download server? Or actually, is there a rule in the Makefile to create a \"clean\" package?"
