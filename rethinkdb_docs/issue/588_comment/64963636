      "You're right\8212somehow I never saw it.  I *think* what happened is that the 30-second quickstart immediately referred me to the installation page, which referred me to the installation page for OS X, and then when I came back from installing I returned to a different browser tab (the ten-minute version) and never finished reading the 30-second version.  When the ten-minute version referred me back to the 30-second guide I skipped it, thinking I had already been there and done that and didn't want to go in circles.\r\n\r\n"
