      "So for upgrading from 1.8\8211\&1.12, you'll need to follow the \"migrating old data\" directions we already have -- those should let you migrate directly from those versions up to 2.1, right?\r\n\r\nAnd we still have a link to the [deprecated migration script](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/tree/02b4f29e1e7f15b3edffcb68bf015578ec5783ab/scripts/migration) for version 1.7 or earlier. Does that require you to upgrade to an earlier version and then upgrade from there, or can it work to upgrade directly to 2.1?"
