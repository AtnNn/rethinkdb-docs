      "> So for upgrading from 1.8\8211\&1.12, you'll need to follow the \"migrating old data\" directions we already have -- those should let you migrate directly from those versions up to 2.1, right?\r\n\r\nThis is correct as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nThe deprecated migration script should also allow for directly upgrading to 2.1 from even older versions, though I wouldn't bet that it still works."
