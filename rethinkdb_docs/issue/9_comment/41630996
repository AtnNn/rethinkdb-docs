      "Once the JSON protocol gets in, the only hard limit left is the limit on arrays.\r\n\r\nThen all the other limits are kind of fuzzy, and I roughly know how many tables my laptop can take, but not a DO droplet or a AWS machine.\r\nSo it's basically kind of hard and \r\n- I want to write about types first -- https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/40 \r\n- I have a lot of small little things to do (promises etc.)\r\n\r\nSo I probably won't have time to do it soon, but I will."
