      "> I see two ways of isolating it with RethinkDB\r\n\r\nYou're right about your assessment. I realize the operational challenges of running an instance/customer, and we'll be working very hard to fix scalability issues.\r\n\r\n> Is it per db or per cluster?\r\n\r\nIt is per cluster.\r\n\r\n> What ops exactly do you have in mind when you say \"has a linear effect on some operations\"?\r\n\r\nAny administrative operation. Here are some examples of things that will slow down:\r\n\r\n* Adding/removing a table\r\n* Adding/remove a database\r\n* Changing replication settings\r\n* Changing sharding settings\r\n\r\nData operations (i.e. queries you run through client drivers) should not slow down.\r\n\r\nCan you talk about the timelines/specifics of your project? (You can always shoot me an email to slava@rethinkdb.com if you'd prefer not to talk about it publicly)"
