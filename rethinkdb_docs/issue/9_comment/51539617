      "I have a skeleton document on this, but there are a lot of question marks to fill in -- most of which are based on questions raised in comments here that aren't explicitly answered anywhere. The answers to a lot of them might be \"it depends.\" :)\r\n\r\n- maximum number of databases per cluster\r\n- max number of shards\r\n- max number of tables per database or cluster ( \"< 1000\" was mentioned above, but...?)\r\n- max size of a document in a table (10M was mentioned, but that's not correct)\r\n- max size of a query (64M?)\r\n- minimum required storage per database\r\n- minimum required storage per table\r\n\r\n...and any other hard limits that I should include. MongoDB's page on this is pretty detailed, getting into things like how long table, DB and field names can be."
