      "I'd like to ping for a few examples of `fold` in practice. The examples in rethinkdb/rethinkdb#3736 are good, but they're all for the `concatMap` style with the emitting function -- there's no examples of just using `sequence.fold(base, function)` to get a value. And we definitely need at least one example for both forms that draws its sequence from a table rather than a ReQL expression. (The \"return every third row\" example does that, although it still feels a little contrived.)"
