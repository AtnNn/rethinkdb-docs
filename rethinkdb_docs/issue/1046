      Just
        "`conn.server()` was fixed to handle proxies; in particular: The object returned by `conn.server()` when connected to a RethinkDB persistent node has the `id`, `name`, and `proxy` fields where `proxy` is set to `false`. When connected to a proxy node, `conn.server()` will return an object with only `id` and `proxy` fields (no `name`), and `proxy` will be set to `true`.\r\n\r\nChanged for https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5485, but note that the `proxy` field name implemented is not the one initially proposed in that issue."
