      "Another small change in 2.3: `eachAsync` no longer stops iterating if the user returns `false` from the callback.\r\nIt looks like we had never documented this detail in http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/each_async/ explicitly anyway, apart from saying \"in an identical fashion to `each`\".\r\n\r\nWe do currently mention this for `each` (http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/each/ : \"when there are no more rows or when the callback returns `false`\"), and this is still correct in 2.3."
