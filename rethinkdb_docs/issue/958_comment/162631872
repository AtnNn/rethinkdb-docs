      "@chipotle If the user wants to pass custom tags to `reconfigure`, yes. The reconfiguration in the web UI and the default configuration that `reconfigure` generate only consider the `default` tag, so removing that is enough in that case.\r\nIn either case I agree it makes sense to recommend removing all tags. It certainly won't hurt and will be less confusing if users have more complex configurations."
