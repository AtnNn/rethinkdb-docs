      "- Given a document, I want to insert if if there is no document saved with the primary key, or replace (and not update) the document if it exists. I don't remember who asked that and what exactly was the use case, but I think it was someone on IRC.\r\n\r\n\r\n- With 1.11.2, this query works fine\r\n```js\r\nr.db('test').table('test').get(1).replace({\r\n        id: 1,\r\n        value: r.js(\"Math.random()\")\r\n}).run(conn, callback)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can pass an object `{nonAtomic: <boolean>}` as a second argument to replace, but it doesn't change anything (tested with Python and JavaScript). So it's probably a bug?\r\n\r\nFor https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/899, I'll open another pull request later."
