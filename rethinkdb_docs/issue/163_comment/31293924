      "Thanks @neumino -- I'll review tomorrow.\r\n\r\nA couple of questions:\r\n\r\n* What do you mean by \"cannot do upsert like a replace\"?  If you mean that you cannot do an upsert operation by calling the `replace` command, that's true, and that's by design. You can do it by calling `insert` with the upsert flag set.\r\n* What do you mean by `nonAtomic` flag doesn't exist in `replace`? I just checked it and it exists and works.\r\n\r\nAlso, we won't fix #899 in the near future FYI. If you write up a recipe for it, could you make it a separate pull request?"
