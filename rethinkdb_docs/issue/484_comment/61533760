      "> we could rename the document \"Starting RethinkDB,\" reorganize what's there a little,\r\n\r\n:+1: something we should definitely do.\r\n\r\nIn addition I think we should have a separate document that's just about cluster configuration as @coffeemug said. The document should not just focus on the configuration options, but give a higher level overview addressing questions such as the one which node(s) clients should connect to, and have links to the more detailed documents on how to secure a cluster, on what to do in case of a node failure etc.\r\n\r\nIn fact we could consider structuring it as a FAQ. What do you think? (@chipotle)\r\n\r\nWe should also adapt http://rethinkdb.com/docs/start-a-cluster/ a little bit. It's a nice tutorial for people who want to play around with RethinkDB, but has little significance for production deployments. It currently links to the \"Create a cluster for system startup\" as a resource for how to set up a production cluster. At the very least we should replace that link with a link to the new clustering overview document."
