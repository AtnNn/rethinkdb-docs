      "@danielmewes we have two client machines, how do we connect both of them using proxy server? As you said earlier:\r\n\"To start a RethinkDB proxy on the client:\r\nrethinkdb proxy -j <server1host> -j <server2host> ...\"\r\nonly of the clients can connect in this way, since the ports will already be in use.
