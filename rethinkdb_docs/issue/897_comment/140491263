      "I\"m not sure whether the 10-Minute Guide is the appropriate place for it given that it's sort of a quick ReQL tutorial, although mentioning it in passing and linking to a more detailed page might fit. The cookbook definitely doesn't seem like the right place, though. Adding it to the `connect` page seems like a good idea.\r\n\r\nI'd actually think the \"primary page\" for this info -- which admittedly doesn't have it right now -- would be the \"Installing the Python driver\" page.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/python/\r\n\r\nWith JS I think this is irrelevant, but is the Ruby driver subject to a similar limitation?"
