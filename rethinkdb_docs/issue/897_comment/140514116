      "The problem is defining just what the \"jumping off point\" is. I don't think anyone is going to be able to write a ReQL application just with the 10-minute guide, for instance; it's written to be used interactively and warns you explicitly not to use `repl` in production code. I would rather put the thread issue on the Python driver installation page, which users should see before this.\r\n\r\nSometimes it's more a matter of figuring out where the information goes and how to highlight it. For instance, the dcoumentation for `connect` actually *does* mention that the driver is not thread-safe, and it even links to rethinkdb/rethinkdb#2427. (You do have to go to the [API page for connect](http://rethinkdb.com/api/python/connect/), not just the index page.) I will put that in a more highlighted box."
