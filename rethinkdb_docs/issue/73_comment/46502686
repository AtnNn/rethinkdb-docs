      "All right, I see arrays *do* work and don't get dropped, and they appear\r\nfirst, followed by numbers and then followed by strings. (I have a\r\nsecondary index on a table and have been trying out multiple data types to\r\nsee what the resulting sort order is.) Is it correct to say that all values\r\nare stored *except* `null` and objects?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Jun 18, 2014 at 3:20 PM, Michel <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> @chipotle <https://github.com/chipotle> -- arrays are stored I think\r\n>\r\n> You can store something like\r\n>\r\n> {\r\n>   $reql_type$: \"TIME\", epoch_time: 0, timezone: \"+00:00\"\r\n> }\r\n>\r\n> \8212\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\r\n> <https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/73#issuecomment-46502006>.\r\n>"
