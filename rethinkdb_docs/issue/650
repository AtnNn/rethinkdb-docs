        "A user on Stack Overflow [points out](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28466581/rethinkdb-can-i-group-by-day-week-month) that we don't have an example in the `group` documentation of grouping documents by day, week, month, or year.\r\n\r\n> My table has a timestamp field, which is a standard RethinkDB date field. Can I group rows by day / week / month using this timestamp field? Couldn't find any example in the group() docs.\r\n\r\nWe should add one to either the dates and times article, and the `group` API docs -- this seems like a pretty common task, and is a good example of ReQL being composable."
