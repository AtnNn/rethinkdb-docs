      "@neumino noted here https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1196#issuecomment-64869551 that there's a special case that we should mention in the section on \"Implicit variables\" of the document.\r\n\r\nWe should mention the special corner case for `orderBy` in combination with `r.asc` and `r.desc`. Specifically, `r.desc`/`r.asc` must not be wrapped into a function even if their argument contains the implicit variable (`r.row`). Instead the function wrapping should happen inside `r.desc`/`r.asc`."
