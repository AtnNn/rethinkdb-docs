      "I see the comment from @atnn that `forEach` is \"a map that combines the results by adding numbers and concatenating arrays,\" but is that an actual use case for this command that needs to be documented, or is it a kind of quirky byproduct? My impression was that it's really only designed for write queries.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table('users').forEach(function (doc) {\r\n  return r.table('foreach').insert({posts: doc('posts')});\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat appears to return just what you'd expect from inserting *n* documents."
