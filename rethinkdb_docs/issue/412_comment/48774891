      "I think something with questions that often come up when people are first trying to use RethinkDB makes sense, even if it's mostly a set of links to other places in the documentation. Performance issues, troubleshooting issues, etc.\r\n\r\nRight now we have a set of troubleshooting questions that's separate from the FAQ, but is that really standard? I see a lot of FAQs that cover troubleshooting and are just a lot longer than Rethink's in general. Compare ours to [MongoDB's FAQ](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/faq/), for instance. Are any of those questions ones that we might reasonably expect users to ask? Our FAQ is very high-level and general. We more or less tell you that RethinkDB doesn't have full ACID support, for instance, but there's no FAQ entry that's simply \"Does RethinkDB support ACID transactions?\""
