      "Hum, I'm not quite sure.\r\n\r\nI think in this case (or in general for one line result), command line style looks better.\r\nI don't really like the fact that I cannot select the query with a double click though.\r\n\r\nIn this case I'm not sure that code/result is better. So I'm ok with that -- so we can merge it as it is (modulo the missing `js`)"
