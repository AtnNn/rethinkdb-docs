        "We found that opening connections with the new user authentication has significant overhead in at least some of the drivers.\r\n\r\nHence there will be an additional option when writing to the `users` table.\r\nDocuments will still look the same in the table, i.e. `{id: \"username\", password: bool}`. You can still set the password by setting the `password` field to a string.\r\nHowever additionally, you can set the `password` field to an object of the form `{password: \"...\", iterations: 4096}`. E.g. `r.db('rethinkdb').table('users').get('username').update({password: {password: \"my secret\", iterations: 10000}})`.\r\n\r\n`iterations` determines how often the password is hashed during the connection handshake.\r\n`iterations` can be increased when setting the password to raise the security of the password by making it harder to brute-force, at the cost of higher CPU costs on the clients when establishing a connection. Alternatively `iterations` can be decreased to make connection setup more efficient, but at the cost of providing less protection against brute-force attacks.\r\nIf the string version is used, the iteration setting implicitly defaults to 4096.\r\n\r\nNote that it's not possible to read which `iterations` value was used from the `users` table. It can only be specified when setting a new password."
