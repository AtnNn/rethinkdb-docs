      "There's an \"improve cluster management documentation\" ticket open as well, #631. Given that we do have documentation that explicitly addresses scaling in its tile now, I'd like to go ahead and close this ticket. I know the phrase \"multi-datacenter\" doesn't appear in the sidebar, but it doesn't appear in MongoDB's doc sidebar, either (or MySQL's, for that matter); I think users will be able to find it. We'll also reference it in the cluster management docs when they're written."
