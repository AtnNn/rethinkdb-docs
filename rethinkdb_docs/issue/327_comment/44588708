      "I think I like the separation based on output size, too -- if it's\r\nreturning just one line, it could be grouped with the code that runs it.\r\nThe only question is whether the \">\" prefix to distinguish input from\r\noutput is the right thing, but I suspect it will be pretty clear to most\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, May 29, 2014 at 2:15 PM, Slava Akhmechet <notifications@github.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> I agree with @neumino <https://github.com/neumino> -- I think that for\r\n> one-liners having the result printed inline is clearly better, and for\r\n> large output having the result printed on a separate line is clearly\r\n> better.
