      "I agree with @neumino -- I think that for one-liners having the result printed inline is clearly better, and for large output having the result printed on a separate line is clearly better. There is a fuzzy line somewhere in the middle where we should switch modes, but I'm not sure how big the output has to be for that to happen -- we can deal with it on case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\nIn this particular example (`split`) I think we should switch Javascript to use the inline notation -- it seems clearly better. I can see how printing small output inline could be confusing for Node users, but I think that's ok -- they only have to learn what's going on once, and can benefit from a compact notation forever after that.\r\n"
