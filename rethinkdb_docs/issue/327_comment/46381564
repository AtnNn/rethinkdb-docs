      "We need to decide something about this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout `>`, I would prefer not to have one, because it's annoying when you want to copy things (that also apply to the `$` sign we use for bash commands). I find that more annoying as a user than anything else - it's harder to select.\r\nBut I'm not really opposed having `>` as long it's consistent.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would be ok to have results inside the same block in JavaScript too as long as we add a comment like this. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n> r.expr({foo: 1).add({bar :2}).run(conn, callback)\r\n// result passed to callback:\r\n{foo: 1, bar: 2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes that work for everyone? \r\nPing @coffeemug @chipotle @mlucy "
