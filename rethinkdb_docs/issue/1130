        "We have some examples for filtering by nested attributes using the pathspec format in http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/filter/ .\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to also have an example and an explanation of how the pathspec syntax works in https://rethinkdb.com/docs/nested-fields/javascript/ .\r\n\r\nCurrently, that document doesn't explain how to use `filter` on nested fields at all. Pathspecs also work for some other commands, such as `pluck` I believe. So it would be nice to explain the general concept with a few examples in the nested-fields document.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5793 and https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5796 for the whole story of how this issue came along."
