      "@larkost and @coffeemug  In a microservice system running containers, in my case is kubernetes. Should I have each microservice use its own `rethinkdb proxy` inside the pod? My concern is that could make hundreds of `rethinkdb proxy`, could that make the rethinkdb cluster performance worse or not at all?"
