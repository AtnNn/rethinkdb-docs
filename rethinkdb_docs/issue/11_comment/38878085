      "Can someone explain to me what's a use case for rethinkdb proxy?\r\n\r\nI get what it does I think, but I can't think of what to do with it.\r\nI thought about using it to create to join two network to create a virtual network, but that doesn't work. It's the same problem as setting a ssh tunnel between two networks.\r\n\r\nIf I have 2 machines 1 and 2 in network A, start `rethinkdb proxy` on network A with `--bind all`, and have a machine 3 in network B that joins the proxy, I get:\r\n\r\n- 1 and 2 don't know about 3\r\n- 3 knows about 1 and 2 but can't connect to it."
