      "In addition to the points @mlucy mentioned, a `rethinkdb proxy` node is also aware of other nodes that might become unavailable so is the best tool we have to keep a stable connection to the cluster when things go bad.\r\n\r\nPersonally I see the `poxy` nodes as becoming more and more important as our ability to scale increases."
