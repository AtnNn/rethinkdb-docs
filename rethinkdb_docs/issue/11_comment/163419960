      "@ntquyen We haven't really tested anything of that scale. I suspect that there won't be any problems if you stay below 100 proxies or so, but there might be some unexpected slowdowns when getting to a multitude of that.\r\nAlso note that proxies are not completely light-weight. While they need less RAM than \"proper\" RethinkDB servers, and don't need any storage, they will still need a significant amount of RAM for processing queries (depending on which types of queries you're running)."
