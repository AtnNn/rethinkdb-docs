        "@nguyendn, Let me know via IRC that when running a command like. \r\n\r\n```\r\nr.table().update((), {return_changes:True})\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat will work but in the docs it using the key returnChanges. This was also broken when it was returnVals when it should have been return_vals. I have not had a chance to test this since i nromally use the php driver and this is related to the js driver."
