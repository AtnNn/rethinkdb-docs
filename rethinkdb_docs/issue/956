        "Currently, the r.literal introduction is something like:\r\n\r\n\r\n> Replace an object in a field instead of merging it with an existing object in a merge or update operation. Using literal with no arguments in a merge or update operation will remove the corresponding field.\r\n\r\nI think this is a bit confusing because it starts out by explaining what `r.literal` does, which is very complicated. I think a re-formulation indicating it acts more like a marker than like a function would be nice. Here's a stab at it:\r\n\r\n> A marker term that indicates to the `update` and `merge` terms that a field in an object should be replaced entirely by the value passed to `r.literal`, rather than being merged with it. If `r.literal` is not passed an argument, `update` and `merge` will remove the field from the resulting document.\r\n"
