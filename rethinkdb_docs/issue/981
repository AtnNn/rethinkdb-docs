        "In [the client driver page](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/) we use a generic \"text in a box\" logo for the Go community driver, which sticks out like a sore thumb to someone that regularly uses Go.\r\n\r\nThe Go Gopher is the mascot of Go, and is the closest thing they have to a logo. Some assets are here: https://golang.org/doc/gopher/ ([`gophercolor.png`](https://golang.org/doc/gopher/gophercolor.png) in particular looks nice) all of which are licensed CC-BY."
