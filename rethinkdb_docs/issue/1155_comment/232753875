      "Ah, this is not the FAQ page, it is the \"Answers to Common Questions\" page, which is actually a blog entry. So this needs to be re-opened in the `www` repository.\r\n\r\nI've been told there is some historical reason why the \"FAQ\" in the documentation is not actually a list of Frequently Asked Questions but instead is largely about architecture (which is why it's in the architecture TOC section for now), but I really think we should consider moving \"Answers to Common Questions\" into the FAQ page sometime and make it a FAQ-as-the-term-is-commonly-used page."
