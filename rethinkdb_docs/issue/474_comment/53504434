      "Correct, the server still uses protobufs internally. It is only from the drivers that we have eliminated the use of it.\r\n\r\nAnd for strict clarity: for the moment we still speak the protobuf wire-format to keep compatibility with existing third-party drivers. At some point in the future that compatibility will be removed, but that has not been decided yet."
