        "The documentation for `tableCreate()` notes that if you try to create a table that already exists, the client driver will raise RqlRuntimeError.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for `indexCreate()` does _not_ mention this, so I assumed it was a silently idempotent operation. Turns out that's not true -- `indexCreate()` actually behaves identically to `tableCreate()`. I like that the functions themselves are consistent, but the docs don't really communicate that IMHO.\r\n\r\nI suppose this issue could apply to _all_ ReQL commands which behave in this way, too."
