      Just
        "`intersects` and `includes` do not utilize indexes. I suggest that we add a note that `getIntersecting` should be used for large data sets to make use of a geospatial index.\r\n\r\nIn case of `intersects`, the rewrite is straight-forward. In case of `includes`, `getIntersecting` can be used as a pre-filter, with an additional `.filter(something.includes(r.row))` strapped behind it (since intersection will provide a superset of the results that are fully included in the given geometry)."
