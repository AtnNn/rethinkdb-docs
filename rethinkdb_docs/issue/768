        "I really like http://rethinkdb.com/docs/writing-drivers/ for understanding the overall process for building a driver, and have seen https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/rdb_protocol/ql2.proto. However I feel like there is a spot in the middle missing for a formal spec describing each version of the protocol. I'm particularly interested in understanding the differences between v03 and v04, and can't seem to find a comprehensive list of changes.\r\n\r\nOn the [RFC for the protocol](http://www.rethinkdb.com/blog/rethinkdb-wire-protocol-call-for-comments/), it looked like there was a wiki article with these details - https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/wiki/protobuf_rfc_raw_spec, but the wiki seems to have been closed as that just redirects to rethinkdb/rethinkdb.\r\n\r\nAre you able to help point me towards the right docs? It would be good to link to them from the writing drivers page as well."
