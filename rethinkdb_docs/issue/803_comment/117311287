      "For the PHP driver, I'm using some heuristics to automatically translate the JavaScript examples to PHP syntax, and then apply a final patch to accommodate differences that cannot be translated automatically.\r\nSee https://github.com/danielmewes/php-rql/tree/master/docs for the scripts and a README.\r\n\r\nIt is a pretty hacky solution, but might work for some other languages as well.\r\n\r\nYour second proposal I think is going to be 70% covered by https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/710. Those changes are going to make the parts that are specific to different languages explicit. The missing part would be to provide a convenient way of maintaining the language-specific pieces separately, though it should be fairly easy to write your own scripts for doing that."
