        "https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3391 removes the `--no-direct-io` server flag.\r\nIn the current implementation, the server still accepts it for backwards compatiblity but prints a warning that it has been deprecated and has been ignored.\r\n\r\nInstead we now have a `--direct-io` flag with the opposite meaning.\r\n\r\nThe default has also changed: We are not using direct I/O by default anymore.\r\n\r\nFrom what I could find, these doc pages have to be updated:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/architecture/ \"Which file systems are supported?\"\r\n> RethinkDB supports most commonly used file systems. However, like most database systems, RethinkDB uses the DIRECT_IO mechanism to access disk efficiently when it is available. Some filesystems cannot be accessed using the DIRECT_IO mechanism, but they can still be used to run RethinkDB with degraded performance. Some encrypted and journaled filesystems do not allow direct disk access, RethinkDB might fail to start if you try to place data files onto such filesystems.\r\n\r\nWe could change that point to\r\n> RethinkDB supports most commonly used file systems.\r\n> Some filesystems cannot be accessed using the DIRECT_IO mechanism, which RethinkDB optionally supports through the `--direct-io` server parameter. While it is technically supported, we also discourage using the `--direct-io` option in combination with BTRFS, since this is poorly tested.\r\n\r\n...though I think we should rather remove that question completely, or just make it \"RethinkDB supports most commonly used file systems.\".\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/cluster-on-startup/\r\n> `no-direct-io` \8212 Disable direct I/O.\r\n\r\nshould be changed to\r\n> `direct-io` \8212 Use direct I/O for file access."
