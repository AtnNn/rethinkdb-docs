      "I'm expanding the description of the `default` optarg considerably and dropping the link to the `default()` command, because even if that's what it's using internally it doesn't have quite the same effect in practice: you can set it to a value other than `true`, `false` and `r.error()` but it doesn't seem like doing so is actually useful. (One might argue that the optarg might have been better named `skip`, but it's probably too late to do that.)\r\n\r\nAs for examples, though, I don't think we're really short on those -- `filter` just went through a fairly major reorganization and there's a whole section titled \"handling missing fields.\""
