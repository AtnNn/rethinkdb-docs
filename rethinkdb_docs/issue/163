        "I've only updated the JavaScript files (and not the index).\r\n\r\n@coffeemug could you take a look at it? I'll copy paste to other languages when there won't be any error left.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso from writing the docs, I ran into a few issues:\r\n- We cannot do a upsert that behave like a replace -- See https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1570\r\n- The `nonAtomic` flag doesn't exist for `replace`. Is that expected?\r\nI am also not convinced that we need this flag.\r\n\r\n\r\nI didn't write on how to handle errors with write operations. If we don't plan to address https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/899 in the near future, I'll add some recipes in the cookbook or maybe write something about best practices (that would include how to use connections, cursors etc.)\r\n\r\nRelated issue: #71 "
