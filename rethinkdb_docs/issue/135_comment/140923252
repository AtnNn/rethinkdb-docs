      "This ticket predates the current docs for `do`; while there's still no example that chains off a datum like the example above, I don't think we need one. (I'd actually argue that since such an example is pretty far off from the use cases we describe `do` as being good for, it might be counterproductive.)\r\n\r\nIf someone feels really strongly about this, we can re-open it."
