        "Did a quick scan of the individual markdown files and noticed some blatant inconsistencies.  Most notably:\r\n\r\n - some files were copy/pasted and had incorrect descriptions\r\n - under_score/camelCase inconsistencies between the title and syntax sections\r\n - missing close brackets\r\n - inconsistencies between syntax and examples\r\n - incorrect function name in the syntax section\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing these, I added the non-operator comparison functions to the ruby and python comparison docs.  Both usages are now mentioned in the title, similar functions, syntax, and examples."
