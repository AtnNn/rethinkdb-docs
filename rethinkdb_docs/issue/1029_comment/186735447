      "Hi,\r\nI am new to RethinkDB and trying to explore and learn, I apologize for any inconvenience.\r\nI noticed the `permalink: ` header states `docs/cookbook` and while browsing the deployed website it redirects to `docs/cookbook/javascript`. There is no way to reach `docs/cookbook` [here](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/cookbook/) other than editing the URL in the address bar?\r\nSo, I tried to edit the URL and may not have entered the right thing, my bad.\r\nUnable to reproduce the problem, the issue is good be closed."
