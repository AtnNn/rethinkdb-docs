      "The \"control structures\" section right now doesn't make much sense.  `r.do` and `r.branch` make sense there, but `r.json`, `r.info`, and `r.js` don't so much.  I would break it up personally.\r\n\r\n(Also, I think @Tryneus should write the first draft of docs for this since he implemented the command.  It's easier not to miss things that way.)"
