      "From what I can see we leave the `.run` out of the signature but put it in the examples, unless this is a special case. By \"call via chaining\" I meant that it looks like `http` is something that has to be called on `r.`, not a previous command -- you can do `r.http().something()` but not `r.something().http()`, right?\r\n\r\nFor a section that included `r.json`, `r.info`, `r.http` and friends, maybe \"Expressions\" is the right term?\r\n\r\n(And it's probably a good idea for developers to do a first pass on docs, for the reason @mlucy mentioned.)"
