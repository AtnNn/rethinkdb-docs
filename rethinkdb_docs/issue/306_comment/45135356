      "A user asked some great questions about `r.http`. I'm going to write a tutorial, and it should cover all those questions. Here they are, so I don't forget:\r\n\r\n- What's the objective of r.http?\r\n- Can I request a JSON from an API (like Github, Twitter, Facebook) and save in a RethinkDB document with r.http?\r\n  - If yes, can I do something with the requested JSON, like select only some fields, or process the data with some parse function?\r\n  - If yes, what's the advantage of use r.http instead of, for example, make a request with cURL from the app and send to RethinkDB?\r\n- Do you guys have any example app using r.http?\r\n- If I create an app with Ruby and another with Node.JS (for example), r.http will have the same result?"
