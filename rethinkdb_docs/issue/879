        "http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/connect/\r\n\r\nThe `caCert` option changed before the release. It is actually broken completely in the driver we shipped with 2.1, but once we have that issue fixed, it's going to work as follows:\r\n* instead of `caCerts`, the option is called `ca`\r\n* the `ca` option takes an array of strings of `Buffer`s containing certificates in the PEM format. In contrast to the other drivers, the certificate is not automatically loaded from a file but must be loaded manually.\r\n\r\nThe full set of options that can be passed into the `ssl` dictionary are listed here: https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback\r\nWe actually just pass them through to `tls.connect`.\r\n\r\nAn example of how the `ca` option can be used is in this PR by @pauliusuza https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/4786#issue-104478657"
