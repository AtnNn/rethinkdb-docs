        "The [build instructions](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/build/) and the installation page for each platform recommend doing a shallow clone:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone --depth 1 -b v1.12.x https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is usually better for users to use the source distribution:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget http://download.rethinkdb.com/dist/rethinkdb-latest.tgz\r\ntar xf rethinkdb-latest.tgz\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe tarball contains the v8 source and pre-compiled web assets. Users who just want to build rethinkdb can do so faster and with fewer dependencies. It also avoids many common npm and v8 related build failures.\r\n\r\nPerhaps instructions for cloning the git repository and installing the extra dependencies can be moved to the \"Hack on the database\" section of the website."
