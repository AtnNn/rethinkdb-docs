      "Ah, thanks for pointing it out. Indeed that page doesn't exist in the (currently stable) 2.0 docs.\r\n\r\nMaybe the best general solution for this problem is to install a custom 404 page that detects if the requested page was in /docs or /api and then shows a custom message suggesting to go to the docs/api index instead?\r\n@mglukhovsky what do you think?"
