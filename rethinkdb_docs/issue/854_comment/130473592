      "While I like the simplification, I'm not sure I like the Erlang arity bit; it's a fairly unusual notation we'd need to explain, and nearly all of our cases only take one argument. I'd consider just going with `function`, `write_function` and `predicate_function`, and specifically say \"one or more arguments\" or \"two arguments\" in text when necessary."
