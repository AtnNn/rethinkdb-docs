      "@neumino voiced concerns that users might see the `ssl` optarg in the API documentation of `r.connect` and assume that the server supports SSL out of the box and be surprised if they cannot connect.\r\nI'm not sure how likely this is to happen (the servers I know with SSL support still all require some configuration to make it work, like installing a certificate etc.), but we should have a comment with the optarg description I think that states that 'Using SSL with RethinkDB requires additional software on the server. [insert link to \"how to set up an SSL tunnel\" article here]'."
