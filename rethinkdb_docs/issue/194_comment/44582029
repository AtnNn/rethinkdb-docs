      "I didn't fix anything about this. \r\n\r\nNote that one part of https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1928 (the one I commented on) wasn't about a limit on file descriptors or any other ulimit. It was about IP port exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThe other part was about limits being set to low, specifically on OS X. I don't think anything has changed about that. We should still add a troubleshooting entry."
