        "It's possible for reads to see data which has not been written durably to disk. This can lead to some strange situations. For example, the user could send an insert and a read right before a server crashed, and the read could see the inserted document; but then when the server rebooted, the document would not be there. We should document this limitation, perhaps in the \"Write acks and durability\" section of the \"Sharding and replication\" page."
