        "Lately we've got many questions from users who are seeing the \"RethinkDB is using swap\" warning, even though they have plenty of RAM available (e.g. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5865#issuecomment-236632154).\r\n\r\nI've looked into some of those cases, and they were due to the default setting of the `swappiness` Linux kernel parameter.\r\n\r\nThis answer on Askubuntu explains very well what the parameter means and how to change it: http://askubuntu.com/a/103916/209792\r\n\r\nI think we should add an entry to http://rethinkdb.com/docs/troubleshooting/ that explains:\r\n\r\n1. What `swappiness` is (briefly)\r\n2. How to check the current value of `swappiness` (`cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness`)\r\n3. How to change the value (adding the line `vm.swappiness = 10` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`, then reboot)\r\n4. That we recommend a swappiness value of 10 for running RethinkDB.\r\n\r\n@chipotle"
