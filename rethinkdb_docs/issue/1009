Also it might be good idea to explain what conditions should be met for the feeds to keep working and how to handle errors. by conditions I mean you can loose feed if any of the primaries go down or the server you connected goes down.\r\n\r\n...\r\n> We currently lose a changefeed in the scenarios you mention and also if a tables is rebalanced / reconfigured, if the network connection between two relevant servers in the cluster is lost, or if the network connection between the client and the server is lost.\r\n"
