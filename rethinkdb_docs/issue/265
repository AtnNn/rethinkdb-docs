        "\r\nThe JavaScript documentation for tableCreate() (http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/table_create/) suggests that the right option to pass is ```{ durability : 'soft` }``` but an example further below offers ```{ hardDurability : false }```. Which one is it? Or are both equivalent to each other? If the latter, perhaps the document should clarify that.\r\n"
