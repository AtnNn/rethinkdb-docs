      "@danielmewes I'm in particular a ReQL user (not driver developer) that was confused by the errors involving `DATUM` and couldn't find it in the documentation. I didn't think to look under the driver development docs. I knew that sometimes those errors could be fixed with a `.coerceTo('ARRAY')` and sometimes with `.coerceTo('DATUM')` but didn't understand what if any the difference was."
