      "Good points. I forgot that we're using these terms in error messages.\r\n\r\nI think in general ReQL error messages should use type denominators that match the return values of the `.typeOf()` command, which in turn I believe match what we use in the API docs and what we currently describe on https://rethinkdb.com/docs/data-types/ (except for capitalization).\r\nNote that those names differ a bit from what we use in `ql2.proto`. For example we write `SELECTION<OBJECT>` instead of `SINGLE_SELECTION`.\r\n\r\nI think most ReQL error messages already follow this schema.\r\n\r\nThat still leaves some type classes that we use in errors, but don't explain anywhere. `DATUM` is one, and there might be others.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should just add descriptions of `DATUM` and potentially other similar \"abstract\" types to the https://rethinkdb.com/docs/data-types/#rethinkdb-specific-data-types list?"
