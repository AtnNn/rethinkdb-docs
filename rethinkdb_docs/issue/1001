        "@nanodeath suggested [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nanodeath/status/689691463890767873) that it would be good to mention `wait()` on the docs for `tableCreate()`, since that's the most likely place you'll use it.\r\n\r\nI think adding a mention to `dbCreate()` would also be a good thing."
