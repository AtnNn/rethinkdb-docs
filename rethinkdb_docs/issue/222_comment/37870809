      "This sort of feels topsy-turvy to me.  We were originally using a very compact way of representing the results:\r\n\r\n```rb\r\n> query\r\nresult\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way of doing it adds only 1 line per result to the index page.\r\n\r\nWe then switched to a longer way of representing the results, for a variety of reasons.  But then we decided that the longer way was too long, and removed them entirely?\r\n\r\nI think the results are very useful, even while scanning.  I personally feel like we should just use the compact notation and call it a day."
