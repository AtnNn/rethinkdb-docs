      "I think we should (and will) spend a week to design a UI control that will present things properly and make this problem go away. After that, I think we should keep results in the index; people will be able to quickly mouse over them and see full input/output.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should present a collapsed result. For the time being I think we should go with whatever @neumino decides to do."
