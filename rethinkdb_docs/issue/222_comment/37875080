      "BTW, after looking at the docs for `split` (for internal users, see `http://newton:8888/api/javascript/split/`), I think that the long form \"example/result\" is pretty bad.\r\n\r\n@mlucy's version would look way better and be way more readable for cases like `split` where there are short inputs, short outputs, and lots of examples.\r\n\r\nFor cases where there are longer (multiline) inputs and outputs, I think @neumino's version is a lot better."
