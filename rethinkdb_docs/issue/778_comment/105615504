      "Issue #11 has been open since late 2013 on \"document `rethinkdb proxy`\" and most of the discussion in it has been along the lines of \"do we even need this,\" so I haven't followed up on it. It might be a good idea for an engineer to write up a paragraph describing exactly what the `proxy` command does -- I don't fully understand it -- and add this to a few places in the docs, including changefeed docs.\r\n\r\nAlso, #11 suggests that the 2.1 Raft implementation may render this all moot -- although if we're going to have to find a way to keep the 2.0 documentation around in addition to the 2.1 docs, we'll still need to document the way to do this in 2.0."
