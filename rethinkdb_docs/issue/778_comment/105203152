      "We deduplicate changefeed messages inside the cluster, but not between the cluster and clients.  So if you have 1000 clients connected to machine `A` and subscribed to changes on table `T`, and `T` is hosted on machine `B`, and then a change occurs on `T`, we send one message from `B` to `A` and then 1000 messages from `A` to your clients.  So if your clients are on a third machine `C`, you'll get a lot of network traffic from `A` to `C`.\r\n\r\nYou can mitigate this by running `rethinkdb proxy` on machine `C` and then connecting your clients to localhost (which will cause us to deduplicate messages from `A` to the proxy on `C`, and after that sending 1000 messages over the loopback interface is cheap).\r\n\r\nIt might be worth elaborating on this a bit more in the docs.  @chipotle, any thoughts?"
