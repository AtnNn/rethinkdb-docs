      "From what I can see @neumino's comments from here https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/pull/358/files are still not reflected in the docs. So we should keep this open.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I've just noticed is that we don't link to the new document from http://rethinkdb.com/community/ (not sure if this is going to be redone anyway for 2.0? @mglukhovsky?).\r\n> Write a new driver \8212 no ReQL driver for your favorite language? Help write one! Hop on the mailing list or #rethinkdb on freenode, and we'll walk you through the driver protocol API.\r\n\r\nstill just links to the ql2.proto file.\r\nhttp://rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/ links to the right document (http://rethinkdb.com/docs/driver-spec/) correctly. I think the Community page should also link to that."
