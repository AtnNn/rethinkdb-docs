      "To quote my comment in #358:\r\n\r\nI think there's some confusion about what this document is supposed to do. Is this supposed to document ReQL as a protocol, or document how to translate between the protobuf format driver developers are currently using and the JSON protocol? I wrote it to do the second; doing the first will produce a much longer document (since it will also have to include all the documentation in ql2.proto)."
