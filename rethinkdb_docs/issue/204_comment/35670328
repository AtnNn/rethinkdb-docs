      "@ccheever -- Thanks for reporting this!  The documentation should probably be clearer.  In particular, the second signature should have `selection<array>` as its return type.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the return types at the top, the non-indexed version of `orderBy` (the third signature) returns an array.  This is because non-indexed `orderBy` has to force all the rows into memory to sort them.\r\n\r\nIf you order using an index (the first signature), you should get back a normal stream, because ordering by an index is efficient and we can give you back rows part-way through."
