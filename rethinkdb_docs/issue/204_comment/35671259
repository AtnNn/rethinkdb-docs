      "Basically \r\n`table.orderBy({index: \"foo\"})` returns a cursor, while `table.orderBy(\"foo\")` returns an array.\r\n\r\nIt's basically this issue: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/604\r\nThe way we fixed this in the current driver, is by providing the same interface for an `array` or a `cursor`. So if you don't want to worry about this issue, consider that what you get back is always a `cursor` (if you get back a stream or an array).\r\n"
