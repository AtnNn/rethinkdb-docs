      "I tried `r.table('games').filter()` in version 2.0.3's data explorer earlier today and it returns an `RqlDriverError`, which I assumed was, more or less, \"the driver can't serialize this query properly.\" Will this be a `CompileError` in 2.1, or is it going to be somewhat driver-dependent?"
