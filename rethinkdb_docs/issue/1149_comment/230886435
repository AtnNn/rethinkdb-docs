      "@ramimoshe We don't really have a name for the `x`. So far we have only incremented it once (from 1 to 2) to mark production-readiness.\r\nIn terms of compatibility, there is no difference between a change in the `y` and a change in the `x`. Both can break backwards compatibility, and are hence considered \"major\" releases.\r\n\r\nIn general we increment `x` to mark particularly relevant milestones in the development of RethinkDB."
