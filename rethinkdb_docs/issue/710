        "Right now we need 3 identical copies of each documentation page, which need to be kept in sync. This is really error prone, and I'm sure super annoying for @chipotle. With the upcoming creation of an official java driver (rethinkdb/rethinkdb#3930) slated for 2.1, the work is about to increase 33%. \r\n\r\nIdeally, what it would be really nice to see are some custom tags that we can pre-process into the final files that jekyll uses (if there's some way to make this a jekyll plugin, even better)\r\n\r\nHypothetically:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn the {{#py \"python\"}}{{#rb \"ruby\"}}{{#js \"javascript\"}} driver, we do things like ...\r\n\r\n{{#py}}\r\nThe python driver uses tornado underneath, so we create generators...\r\n{{/py}}\r\n{{#rb}}\r\nEventmachine is a wonderful way to do magical delightful ruby things...\r\n{{/rb}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving per-language tags as above would be a nice start. Obviously there are some more convenient things we could do, like having a special tag like `{{#lang}}` that outputs the current language's name, since that will probably be common.\r\n\r\n@mglukhovsky @AtnNn thoughts?"
