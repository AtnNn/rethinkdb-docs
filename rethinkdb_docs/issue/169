        "@hammer points out in rethinkdb/rethinkdb#1822 that the instructions for building the driver from source for Python 3 support assumes you're using a Linux-based distribution with `apt`.\r\n\r\nHowever, we officially support RPM-based distros and OS X. At the very least, providing alternate install instructions for dependencies would be an improvement.\r\n\r\n@atnnn, could you look into this?"
