        "I feel like I've been asked about it a lot in the last month, and as far as I can tell we only talk about it as an aside in the changefeed docs.  It might be worth adding a page that talks more about the subject (I'm not quite sure where it would go in our existing scheme).\r\n\r\nWe should probably mention:\r\n* What a proxy node is.\r\n* Why they exist.\r\n* What the performance characteristics are, especially for changefeeds.\r\n* How to start one and what the network config needs to look like (specifically the fact that it behaves like a normal RethinkDB node and thus other nodes in the cluster will try to connect to it).\r\n  - Once https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5138 is resolved we should add docs on how to start a proxy node on system startup too.\r\n\r\n@chipotle, any thoughts on whether this is worthwhile and where it should go?"
