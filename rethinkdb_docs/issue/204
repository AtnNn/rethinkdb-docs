        "When adding an `orderBy` clause to a query run against a connection from JavaScript, it changes what is returned (/ passed to the callback) from a cursor to the result of calling `.toArray()` on that cursor.\r\n\r\nEx.\r\n`fibrous-coffee> conn.sync.run r.db('nametag').table('comments')`\r\nreturns a cursor\r\n\r\n`fibrous-coffee> conn.sync.run r.db('nametag').table('comments').orderBy('commentTime')`\r\nreturns an Array of objects.\r\n\r\nThis is surprising/unexpected. Seems like it should be at least documented here: http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/order_by/"
