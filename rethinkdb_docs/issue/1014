        "We should add a note to http://rethinkdb.com/docs/backup/ to mention that `rethinkdb restore` might not work for restoring backups taken from versions of RethinkDB that are more recent than the one currently running (e.g. you cannot restore a backup from RethinkDB 2.2.x to RethinkDB 2.1.x).\r\n\r\nAs a work-around, the flag `--no-secondary-indexes` can be passed to `rethinkdb restore` to skip restoring secondary indexes. This is usually enough to make the restore work on older versions.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5375 for a related issue."
