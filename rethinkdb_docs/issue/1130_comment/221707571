      "Actually we have been using the term \"pathspec\" a bit liberally here. We have \"pathspecs\" such as `{foo: true}`, `{foo: {nested: true}}` or `{foo: \"nested\"}` for `pluck`, `with_fields` and `has_fields`.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the object-style predicate for `filter`, which works a bit differently and actually compares the values of the fields in the predicate.\r\n\r\nThe former one already has a bunch of good examples and good explanations in the nested-fields doc. The latter one is the one not explained there, which we should probably add."
