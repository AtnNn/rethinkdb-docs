      "The more I look at this, the more this looks like it should be a Cookbook recipe rather than a new example in `merge`; a lot of what's going on here is as much the product of `map`/`concatMap` as merging.\r\n\r\nCould someone give me an example of a use case for this for the cookbook? I can see what's going on in Sebastian's example, but I'm not clear on when you'd want to do that with real data."
