      "The `eq_join` documentation now goes into some detail about `zip`. The examples for `outer_join` and `inner_join` *use* `zip` but don't explain it, they just link to it. However, I'm not sure it's worth elaborating much on it, given that we advise not using these commands and there's still a \"modernizing joins\" proposal open that might get rid of those commands entirely.\r\n\r\nGiven that there's a whole separate document on Map-Reduce, I don't think we should explain how to use `map` in the Table Joins document, and I'm not sure why we'd need to elaborate on `pluck` there specifically.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: closing. Reopen something more specific if it seems like a good idea."
