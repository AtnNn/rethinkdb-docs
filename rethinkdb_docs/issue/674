The only issue is that you have to set up persistent filters via iptables in addition to having an authKey. They do have a guide[0] for that, however they do not provide any instructions for ensuring that the filters on iptables stay up, or how to restore them if they are temporarily wiped out :/\r\n>\r\n>[0] http://rethinkdb.com/docs/security/"
