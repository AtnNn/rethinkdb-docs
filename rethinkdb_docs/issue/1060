However in the case of a primary index, we still only use a single field, even if that field contains array values.\r\n\r\nI suggest:\r\n\"Using an array in the primary key field makes the primary index behave similarly to a compound secondary index; read the documentation on compound secondary indexes for more information, as it applies to primary keys as well. Note that the primary index still can only cover a single field, while compound secondary indexes can cover multiple fields in a single index.\""
