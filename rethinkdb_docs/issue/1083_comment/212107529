      "Thanks for the pull request @gyelwande !\r\n\r\nI think we'll need to change the wording a bit on this. It also mentions some things that are unrelated to the `jobs` table (such as that RethinkDB doesn't use indexes automatically), which we should probably take out.\r\n\r\n@chipotle Do you prefer to rewrite this from scratch or modify based on what @gyelwande wrote?"
