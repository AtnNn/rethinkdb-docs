        "Because of the old version of OpenSSL that Python and Ruby link to the default versions of those interpreters will not be able to support SSL/TLS connections to our driver in the normal mode (when it requires such a connection). Rather you need to startup the server with:\r\n`--tls-min-protocol TLSv1 --tls-ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH:AES256-SHA`\r\n\r\nThis does have the negative effect of opening some security holes in those protocols, but it is better than not having any encrypted method."
