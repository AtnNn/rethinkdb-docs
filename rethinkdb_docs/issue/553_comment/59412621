      "I'd fold \"deploying on AWS\" into the article, but put Compose first (because it's dramatically easier to do). You can borrow copy for the Compose section from our blog post that @segphault wrote.\r\n\r\nNot sure about dotCloud, but my immediate instinct would be not to include it. It isn't actually a good practical way to deploy Rethink in the cloud."
