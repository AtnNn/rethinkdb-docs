      "Ah -- I did see their article on installing RethinkDB on Ubuntu 12.04, but not 14.04.\r\n\r\nDigital Ocean is essentially a VPS provider, not a PaaS setup like Compose or AWS -- the instructions there are applicable to any Ubuntu installation. We might want to think about a revamped community page with links to user-written articles about RethinkDB that include those links, though."
