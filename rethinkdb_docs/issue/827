        "Talked about this with @chipotle .\r\nFor http://docs.rethinkdb.com/2.1/docs/failover/ I think it would be nice to have a shorter summary of the prerequisites for auto failover, possibly in a bullet point list. Something like\r\n\r\n* 3 or more servers\r\n* table configured to 3 replicas\r\n* a majority (at least 2) of replicas must be up\r\n\r\nCurrently this information is in the article, but I think it could be summarized in a more concise way that doesn't require reading through the whole text."
