      "I can follow the gist but I'm not entirely sure what you're requesting from the issue title. :) Is this a cookbook recipe? What's the use case for this? Are you trying to demonstrate how to chain a function to monitoring a change feed, or just demonstrating how to increment a field in a document? (If it's the former, this seems like it's a cookbook recipe for changefeeds, not for insert.)"
