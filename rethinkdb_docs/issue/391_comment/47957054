      "I've made a couple changes. Moving the technical comparison image down\r\nrequired trimming it a bit, but it seems to work. And I've moved the\r\nquickstart image down the page, under the output.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'd call that \"squashing,\" though. :) Making the text reflow\r\nwon't usually hurt readability. (I think moving the quickstart image down\r\nlooks better, but I think the technical comparison image is kind of a draw\r\n(no pun intended).\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Jul 3, 2014 at 9:42 AM, Michel <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> I built the website and looked at the layout.\r\n>\r\n> For the technical comparison, the illustration squashes the first\r\n> paragraph.
