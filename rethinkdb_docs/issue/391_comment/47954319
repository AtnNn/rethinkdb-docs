      "I built the website and looked at the layout.\r\n\r\nFor the technical comparison, the illustration squashes the first paragraph. Could we move the image down, and put it on the right of the 4 bullet points?\r\n\r\nFor the quickstart, I don't like squashing the output of the `rethinkdb` command. While I like the illustration, I think illustrations should make the website delightful without hurting the readability of the content.\r\nI actually don't have a good idea on what to do for the quickstart. We can try to move it after the snippet, on the right of \"Point your browser to...\"?\r\nOr maybe move it at the very end of the quickstart?\r\nOr completely remove it?"
