      "@neumino -- in every case except `next` could you remove the `__Example:__` prefix before `Alternatively, you could use promises` sentence? This way the user sees an example heading (in bold), then code, and then a line saying \"you can also do it this way\" and more code. This way it looks like one example done in two different ways. If you have the prefix `__Example:__` the second time, it looks like two different examples.\r\n\r\nThat was my intention initially, sorry I didn't explain that more clearly."
