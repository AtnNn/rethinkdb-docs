        "I wrote this comment on HN:\r\n\r\n>We have a stable release (v2.0) for those who cannot tolerate breaking changes. \r\n>\r\n> Feature releases (e.g. 2.1, 2.2) include new features and do break compatibility on occasion (so we can quickly introduce new behavior). Any breaking changes are well-documented in the release notes[1], so you can have a smooth upgrade path.\r\n>\r\n> Minor releases (e.g. 2.1.1, 2.1.2) do not have breaking changes, only bugfixes and minor improvements.\r\n\r\nWe documented some of this in our  migration docs (if I remember), but we should add a basic article describing our versioning policy clearly."
