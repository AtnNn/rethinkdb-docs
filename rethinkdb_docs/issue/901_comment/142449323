      "@deontologician Is there `getField` as well? I think we shouldn't use the `bracket` term in the documentation wherever we can avoid it.\r\n\r\nWe added the `bracket` term specifically because `val[idx]` is ambiguous in Python and Ruby, since it can refer to either arrays or objects with slightly different meanings.\r\n\r\nIf you have to write it out anyway, I think there's rarely a reason to use the `bracket` term, and it has a somewhat undescriptive name. Most of the time, using either `getField` or `nth` explicitly makes the query nicer to read."
