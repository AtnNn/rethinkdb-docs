      "Next horrible question: `group`. JavaScript returns an array whose elements are `{ group: \"name\", reduction: <data> }` while Ruby and Python return arrays whose elements are ` { \"group name\": <reduction data>\" }. How does Java do this? And how should I represent the returned data? I'm guessing in reality it's going to be a `Map<String, Object>`, but I don't know if there's a canonical way to represent that in text the way we can represent documents in Python, Ruby or JS. (Maybe just JSON, assuming people will figure that out?)"
