      "I'm probably going to need a couple specific examples about cursors, particularly the equivalents of `each`, `next`, and (since this one seems to be very language-specific) `to_array`. In the `run` command, for instance, the first example is:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfor doc in r.table('marvel').run(conn):\r\n    print doc\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know the correct way to write this in Java."
