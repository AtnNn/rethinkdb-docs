      "The only time bracket might be useful is in very rare situations with complicated queries where you may or may not know what type the index value will be. The conversion script will convert anything like `[some_var]` into `.bracket(some_var)`, but that's just being conservative, in reality you'll almost always know which kind you want. I'd say it's fine to discourage using `.bracket` on the bracket page, but we should probably still document it since the driver does have it implemented."
