      "Also: `bracket` is an explicit method in the java driver, since we can't use the same trick as in the javascript driver to overload the constructor.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table('foo')('x')\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nr.table(\"foo\").bracket(\"x\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, annoyingly, Java doesn't allow single quotes for strings, those are reserved for characters like in C and C++, so everything has to be double quoted "
