      "One difference between the Java and other drivers that's relevant for the `run` documentation:\r\nOur other drivers accept a `noreply=True` option to `run`. The Java driver doesn't accept this option. Instead there is a special method `runNoReply(conn)` to run noreply queries. `runNoReply` works like `run(conn)`, but returns `void` instead."
