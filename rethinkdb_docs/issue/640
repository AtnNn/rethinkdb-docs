        "The documentation for system tables ([`current_issues`](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/system-issues/), [`stats`](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/system-stats/), and [`jobs`](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/system-jobs/)) don't include a basic call at the top for those tables, they immediately dive into examples.\r\n\r\nI'd rewrite, for example, the intro paragraph for `current_issues` as (note added syntax highlighting as well:\r\n\r\n> The `current_issues` table is one of the system tables added in RethinkDB 1.16. Querying it returns problems detected within the cluster; in normal, error-free operation, it will remain empty. The table is read-only. \r\n\r\n> To see current issues reported within the cluster, simply run:\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> r.db('rethinkdb').table('current_issues')\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nSmall sidenote: could we rename the \"Stats\" article to \"Statistics\"?"
