      "@deontologician: if you mean \"is it technically feasible\", then the answer is yes, but it would be bad because that's not how our type system works in general.  We'd have to hard-code that combination, and it would be extremely confusing because `r.binary(r.http())` would work but e.g. `r.binary(\"PREFIX\" + r.http())` still wouldn't.  (In general, having the return type of a term depend on the term calling it seems confusing to me.)"
