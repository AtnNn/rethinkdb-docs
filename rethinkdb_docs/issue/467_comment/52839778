      "@deontologician, does that mean you support my suggestion to have `r.http` produce a binary object when `result_format='auto'` and creating a string fails?  (Note: this should only happen for invalid JSON-P and unrecognized `Content-Type`s from the above list)\r\n\r\n@mlucy, it doesn't seem that having `result_format='auto'` work in this way is much different than how we handle JSON-P."
