      "I was under the impression that @Tryneus fixed the content type issues in `r.http` and you can insert binary data via `r.http` into documents. It's possible that `r.binary(r.http)` doesn't work, but I think there is a different way of doing it.\r\n\r\n@Tryneus -- could you comment on this? Should we make `r.binary(r.http)` work explicitly? (I think we should)"
