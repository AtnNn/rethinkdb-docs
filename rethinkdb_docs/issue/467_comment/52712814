      "@Tryneus: how do we currently detect the result format when it's set to `auto`?  Detecting based on the content-type seems very different from detecting based on the presence or absence of a null byte.\r\n\r\n@deontologician: I don't quite follow.  If the content-type says it's binary data, shouldn't we just return binary data?  Do we not currently do that?"
