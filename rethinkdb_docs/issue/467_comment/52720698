      "Ideally we would validate all strings like that, but we currently don't and haven't ever done that, and I think it would be very unexpected behavior to only validate strings that arrive from `r.http` and nowhere else.  We also can't change it anywhere else without potentially breaking users' applications, so that kind of a change would need to be in a new major version of the query language (e.g. 2.0)."
