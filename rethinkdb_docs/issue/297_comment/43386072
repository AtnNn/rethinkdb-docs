      "> I would expect `r.do` should take at least two arguments.\r\n\r\nThat sounds reasonable. Let's see what @mlucy has to say in case we missed something.\r\n\r\n> And I would expect `r.expr(1).do(r.expr(1))` to throw an error because the first argument of `do` is not a function.\r\n\r\nI disagree. Being able to say `x.do(1)` is really nice in case you just want to get a constant back. We plan to support a similar syntax in `map` (e.g. `x.map(1)`), so I'd keep it in `do`."
