If data is immediately available, it will be returned normally, or if data is not immediately available, `RqlDriverError(\"Timed out waiting for cursor response.\")` will be raised.\r\n\r\nIf `wait` is any number greater than `0`, the same behavior will occur except that we will wait up to `wait` seconds for data to become available before raising the `RqlDriverError`.\r\n\r\nIf the cursor is empty or completely exhausted and `next` is called, a `StopIteration` error will be raised.\r\n\r\n#### In `ruby`:\r\nThere exists a function `Cursor::next()` which accepts an optional argument, which may be `true`, `false`, `nil`, or a number type.\r\n\r\n`cursor.next(true)` (default):\r\nWait indefinitely for the next row of the cursor.\r\n\r\n`cursor.next(false)`, `cursor.next(nil)`, `cursor.next(0)`:\r\nNo wait will be performed.
