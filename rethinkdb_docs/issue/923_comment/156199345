      "I'd suggest that \"How do I produce a changefeed with a union of two or more tables?\" is a cookbook recipe. Adding an example to `union` is also a good idea; we should add more examples that use changefeeds to commands like this. (I don't know if I'd advocate adding an example to `changes()`, though.)\r\n\r\nMaybe the language in the changefeed article needs to be strengthened to emphasize the \"nearly any query can become a changefeed\" aspect of the `.changes()` command. I'm a little leery of adding a section that calls out specific queries, unless we just have a quick list of examples -- but that might be better served by collecting a few more changefeed cookbook entries and linking to the cookbook from the changefeed article."
