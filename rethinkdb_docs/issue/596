I think the full list of supported data types for primary keys should be in the [`tableCreate`](http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/table_create/) docs. In particular, before I came across [this discussion](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2884#issuecomment-65291774) I had no idea storing arrays in the primary key field was supported.\r\n"
