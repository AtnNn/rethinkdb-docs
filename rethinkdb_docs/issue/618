        "A couple of users have run into cases where they wanted to apply a function to a single object and tried using `map(fun)` for it (e.g. https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2768).\r\n\r\nHowever `map` can only be applied to arrays or sequences of data. The equivalent for a single item is `do()`.\r\n\r\nThe API documentation http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/map/ should have a note on the fact that `do` must be used instead for applying a function to single items, and list `do` as a \"Related command\" probably."
