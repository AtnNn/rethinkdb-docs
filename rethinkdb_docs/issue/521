        "This doc http://rethinkdb.com/docs/geo-support should have a quick FAQ. Here are some questions asked by jimktrains2 on HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8368558), and there probably will be more in that thread:\r\n\r\n- How many dimensions are supported?\r\n- Does this support many projections, or just a few. I see \"geoSystem: 'WGS84'\" which isn't an EPGS identifier. Along those lines, are distance calculations done on a geodesic, a plane, or is that configurable (some projections are a planer, others aren't).\r\n- Also, what does this mean? `geometry.distance(geometry[, {geoSystem: 'WGS84', unit: 'm'}])` Does this do a correct interpolation of degrees to meters along the path (again based on the projection) or is there a fixed constant?\r\n- Are there commands to export WKT or WKB?"
