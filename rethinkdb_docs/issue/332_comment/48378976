      "One clarification: I noticed that in the `db` command it doesn't mention what happens when you don't specify a database at all, i.e., just call run `r.table('foo').run()` or the like. It *looks* like what happens is that the command is run against the most recently-selected database. Is that correct, and is it worth documenting?"
