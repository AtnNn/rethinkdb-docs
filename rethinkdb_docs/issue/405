        "I've been recently often asked why we cannot chain an `orderBy` with an index after a `getAll`.\r\n\r\nIt seems fair to me that users shouldn't have to understand how exactly an index work to be able to infer what's possible and what's not.\r\nWe should add that in the secondary indexes article (with the current limitations).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe at some point we should write about indexes like we wrote about lambda functions, but that seems a little less important."
