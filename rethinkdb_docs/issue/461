        "I had a chat with @nickpoorman about building RethinkDB from source on Ubuntu 14.04.1.\r\nHere are a few issues about our build instructions http://rethinkdb.com/docs/build/ that came up:\r\n\r\n1. The list of packages to install is missing `m4`, and - as long as https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2676 is open - it should also include `curl libcurl3 libcurl4-openssl-dev` (is this right? libcurl version 3, but libcurl*-dev in version 4?).\r\n2. The last step \"Build the server\" should have `./configure --allow-fetch` instead of `./configure`. Also we should mention that `make` should be run with an appropriate `-j` parameter to speed up the built. "
