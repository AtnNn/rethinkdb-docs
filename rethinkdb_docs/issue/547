        "We have a document titled \"Create a cluster on system startup\", but it doesn't address the first question I have: how do I create a multi-node cluster on startup? The document largely assumes that you're running the cluster on one server (which is also important for testing purposes).\r\n\r\nThe answer is to use the `join` configuration option and include the remote host:port. We should add more documentation on how to deploy RethinkDB in a cluster using various existing ops tools and environments. "
