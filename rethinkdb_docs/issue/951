      Just
        "When a user installs RethinkDB from our official Ubuntu package, the installation process displays the following message: \"The RethinkDB startup service is installed but disabled. To enable it,\r\nfollow the instructions in the guide located at http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/startup/\"\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks through the link and arrives at that page, it's not obvious what steps they should follow for Ubuntu. Because Ubuntu has recently adopted systemd, there's now some ambiguity about whether Ubuntu users should follow the steps in the \"Startup with systemd\" section. As far as I can tell, those steps are still unnecessary on Ubuntu and don't actually work in that environment. I think it would be helpful to clarify this so that it's easier for users to understand which instructions are applicable.\r\n\r\n(Thanks to @unculture for bringing this issue to our attention.)"
