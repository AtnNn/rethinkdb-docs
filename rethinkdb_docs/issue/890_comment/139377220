      "I'm really starting to wonder if this is all overthinking things a bit. :)\r\n\r\nWhat we have now reads:\r\n\r\n> Any operation on an author document requires loading all posts into memory. Any update to the document requires rewriting the full array to disk.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't see a big problem with that line; this comes under the heading \"Disadvantages of using embedded arrays\" with respect to modeling relationships (i.e., the `author` document has a field called `posts` that contains an array of all the posts by that author).\r\n\r\n> Deleting, adding or updating a post requires loading the entire `posts` array, modifying it, and writing the entire array back to disk.\r\n"
