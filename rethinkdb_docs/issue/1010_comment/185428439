      "I presume the 8 MB overhead is part of the \"internal metadata\" the memory usage documentation talks about. But is it that the metadata for blocks in RethinkDB will always take up a minimum of 8 MB overhead per table, or is it 8 MB of overhead in _addition_ to the 28 bytes per block? (And is that 28 bytes per block still correct, since it says \"as of RethinkDB 1.13\"?)"
