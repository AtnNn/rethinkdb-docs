      "Thanks for reporting this @christiank .\r\nIn the short term, we should do as you say and document that `indexCreate()` just like `tableCreate()`, fails if the index already exists.\r\n\r\nIn the long term we should document all major error cases for *all* of the ReQL terms. I thought we already had an issue for that, but I cannot find it at the moment (@chipotle do you remember anything like that?). It might make sense to wait doing this until we have a better exception type hierarchy (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/2103)."
