      "We don't keep docs for older versions of the driver protocol. There are however plans to start keeping old docs around (#665).\r\n\r\nYou can find old versions of the driver spec using `git log`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/commits/master/1-get-started/drivers/writing-drivers.md\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/commits/master/1-get-started/drivers/driver_protocol.md\r\n\r\nFor a more authoritative reference, you can take a look at the messages and comments in `ql2.proto`. Use a version tag to get the information for a specific version, for example `git show v1.8.0:src/rdb_protocol/ql2.proto` for RethinkDB 1.8.0.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/commits/master/src/rdb_protocol/ql2.proto\r\n\r\nI believe that the protobuf_rfc_raw_spec page on the old wiki was simply an early version of `ql2.proto`."
