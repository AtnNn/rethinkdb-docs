      "While I think this isn't critical, I agree that the dev mailing list is not easy enough to discover given how useful the driver release posts are for keeping a driver up to date.\r\n\r\n@chipotle Do you think we could have a more prominent box closer to the top of http://rethinkdb.com/docs/writing-drivers/ to point to the mailing list? Something along the lines of \"Join the RethinkDB-Dev Google Group to receive updates on protocol changes.\"?"
