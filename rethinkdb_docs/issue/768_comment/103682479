      "The *rethinkdb-dev* post you link to describes all the differences introduced by RethinkDB 2.0 (aka V0_4).\r\n\r\nAlthough the RethinkDB release notes do not mention the version V0_4 bump, it does mention all the changes to the protocol.\r\n\r\nAs you've discovered, the changes that affect drivers are posted to the mailing list, as described in the [writing-drivers](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/writing-drivers/) article:\r\n\r\n> You can ask questions and get notes on changes introduced in new versions of RethinkDB on the [RethinkDB-Dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rethinkdb-dev)\r\n\r\nAlthough it is not in the repo, it serves as a separate changelog for those changes. Perhaps we could make it easier to discover."
