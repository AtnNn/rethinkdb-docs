      "Internally, the separate branches seem like the best idea.\r\n\r\nThe way a fair number of other projects seem to do this externally is to include the version number in the URL:\r\n\r\n    http://rethinkdb.com/api/2.0/javascript/run\r\n\r\nwith symlinks set up so there's always a `current` version available (or using URL rewriting to do that):\r\n\r\n    http://rethinkdb.com/api/current/javascript/run\r\n\r\nI imagine the deployment/build script could check out the branches in the right place, create the symlink, etc. I don't know if we'd want to keep deploying by building the entire web site locally and then rsyncing to production, though."
