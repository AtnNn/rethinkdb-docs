      "The first line of `between` is \"Get all documents between two keys.\" Maybe we can change this to use essentially the same wording: \"Get all documents between two dates\" and drop the bit about times. I don't think \"to return whether a date is between two other dates\" is the right phrasing; that sounds like it's a boolean test. The way it's phrased now really seems more explicit in describing `during` as an analogue to `between`."
