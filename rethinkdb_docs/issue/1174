        "This comes out of discussion in #1170. It seems like it might make sense to explicitly match the input term (e.g., `stream`, `array`) with the output type, since a `sequence` is going to return something specific, not another `sequence`.\r\n\r\nValid exceptions might be terms that accept any `sequence` and always return an array, or terms that have no practical way to cover all explicit cases like `reduce`, which takes a `sequence` and returns a `value`."
