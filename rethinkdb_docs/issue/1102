        "slice, and other functions work on many different types including strings, so they don't get put into the string manipulation section in the docs. I was looking for something like slice, but thought RethinkDB was missing it because it wasn't in the string manipulation section. I'm not sure what the answer is here. A few possibilities:\r\n\r\n* Leave it the same, people will learn that many RethinkDB functions work on multiple types\r\n* Create a way to view functions by the type they work on, rather than the category (sounds like a lot of work)\r\n* Write a guide on string manipulation with RethinkDB which collates all of the string functions together.\r\n\r\nI think a guide could be a good option. To me string manipulation *feels* like a fundamentally different operation from operating on tables, sequences, or arrays, showing what options you have would be helpful.\r\n\r\nOTOH, I think it's only `slice`, `count`, `coerceTo` that operate on strings and don't sit in the string manipulation section."
