        "http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/replace/ currently mentions the fact that `replace` can be used for inserts and deletions in the description of the return value. I think this should be more visible. I think it should probably be mentioned in a second paragraph before the list of optional arguments.\r\n\r\nAlso http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/insert/ should mention the fact that `replace` can be used to implement more complex atomic `upsert` operations. I forget about this myself occasionally.\r\nWe can remove that hint again once we have https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3753 implemented."
