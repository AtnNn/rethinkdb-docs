      "Hi @kureikain, that's really awesome!\r\n\r\nI took a really quick look and the contents and structure sound interesting and useful. I haven't gone very deep into the contents yet.\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed is that the grammar and spelling can use some improvements. Do you know someone who could do a proof read with respect to these aspects?"
