      "I'm trying to build a connection pool, that from time to time queries `r.db('rethinkdb').table('server_status')` to connect to new servers as they are added and remove the one that were declare dead.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't always work in case of firewalls and such, but for now, I would like to solve the case when the driver is on the same network as the RethinkDB instances.\r\n\r\nHow can I get a list of addresses to use to connect to?\r\nI retrieve a list of canonical address to use per server. Can RethinkDB provide the address it used to connect to this server as the first one? Or the less local?\r\n"
