      "I could revise the document to:\r\n\r\n> **Strings** are (generally) UTF-8 strings: `\"superhero\"`, `\"the quick brown fox\"`, <code>&quot;&uuml;nn&euml;c&euml;ss&auml;r&yuml; &uuml;ml&auml;&uuml;ts&quot;</code>. Strings in RethinkDB can't contain the `null` character. While it's possible to insert a string in RethinkDB that is not valid UTF-8, many ReQL operations assume that strings are UTF-8 encoded.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not quite sure what to make of the edge cases you imply there. Should users be advised to stick to UTF-8 strings? Are there cases where using UTF-8 strings will cause errors or incorrect behavior? Can you use any encoding?"
