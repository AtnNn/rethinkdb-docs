      "I'm trying to figure out how to address this and stick to the style in use in the document. We explicitly tell you everything that's in @AtnNn's bullet list: we accept strings that are *almost* UTF-8 except for not permitting the `null` character; RethinkDB will let you insert strings with different encodings, but you probably shouldn't, because many operations assume UTF-8 and we might enforce it later on.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the sticking point may be that \"(generally)\" is confusing -- I put it in there because they're *not* UTF-8 strings, technically, but it can be reworded. Perhaps just dropping it is the right fix, since the next sentence explicitly reads \"Strings in RethinkDB can't contain the `null` character.\""
