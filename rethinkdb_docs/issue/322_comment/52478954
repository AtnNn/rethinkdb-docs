      "I tried to point out what I perceive as confusing.\r\n\r\nFirst thing is that using that \"generally\" world makes me feel that `null` may not be the only forbidden character and that there might be others. Or that there might be other differences.\r\n\r\nSecond thing is continuity of sentences. After mentioning that `null` is not allowed you continue with \"While it's possible to insert a string that is not valid UTF-8...\". When combined with confusion from \"generally\" world it makes me think you do not consider `null` as valid UTF-8 character. I do not feel those sentences as speaking about two separate matters, but one.\r\n\r\nAnd the last thing is talking about future support of strings. It's not clear whether RethinkDb will enforce UTF-8 or UTF-8 without `null`s.\r\n\r\nWhile first two points above might originate from that English is not my native language I believe that the third point is not affected by that. I hope I explained it well. It's now up to your consideration whether doc will be adjusted or not. "
