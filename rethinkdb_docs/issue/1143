        "The docs at https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/union/ say that the `interleave` option for `union` can accept `true`, `false`, or a field name, but it can also accept a function (with the semantics that we call the function and then interleave based on what it returns, so `interleave: 'foo'` is the same as `interleave: function(row) { return row['foo']; }`)."
