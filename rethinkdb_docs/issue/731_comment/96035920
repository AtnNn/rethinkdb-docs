      "@stuartpb \r\n> And then I run a join on this compound index:\r\n> \r\n> `r.table('watchers').join([r.row('foreignArticleId'),r.row('foreignCommentId')],'posts',{index:'location'})`\r\n> \r\n> for jar7, will this join just join jar, or will it join jar and baz? \r\n\r\nIt will join nothing for `jar7` because the join function errors on that document and so it cannot determine its join key.\r\nFor a similar reason, `jar` can actually never be joined with anything because it will not appear in the secondary index since the secondary index function cannot be evaluated on it. You have to use `default` in the secondary index function if you want to handle missing fields and index those documents in a different way instead."
