      "Regarding my question about omitting documents from a secondary index, using null is/was a way to do that, but there's movement toward making `null` a discrete value (with a place in sorting) for secondary indices - https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1032#issuecomment-39614296 seems to imply the way forward for excluding docs from a secondary index is to use a complex expression that will generate an *error* for these cases (which strikes me as a little weird, if for no other reason than that when I think \"error\", I think \"anomalous operation that gets flagged and logged and might halt the caller\", not \"normal result value\")."
