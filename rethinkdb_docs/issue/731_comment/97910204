      "> I'd say this error behavior should be described up-front in the docs on secondary indices, ie. with a mention in the examples for complex (expression-based) indexes\r\n\r\nI've been digging through this and I confess I've gotten a bit lost. What error behavior are we talking about documenting? The suggestion to use `r.error` as the official way of deliberately omitting documents from secondary indexes?"
