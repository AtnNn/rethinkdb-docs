      "Are r.minval and r.maxval still for use only within `between`, or can they be serialized? I was trying to figure out how I'd sink documents for a secondary index I skim the top of, and it seemed like a good case for using r.maxval or Infinity - or is it possible to just allow those documents to opt out of the index altogether with a value like `null`?"
