      "Renaming issues messes with my workflow and makes it hard to keep track of what's going on.  If it becomes apparent that an issue is poorly titled, I think it's usually better to open a new issue with a better title, then summarize and link to the old issue.  (This has the side-benefit that usually when it's discovered that a title's bad, there's a lot of meandering discussion above that discovery, so the new issue is cleaner and more on-topic.)"
