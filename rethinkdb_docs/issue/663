        "Based on the outline @coffeemug provided in #601, this is a suggestion to expand the existing changefeed documentation somewhat:\r\n\r\n- View changes on a document in realtime (`t.get().changes()`)\r\n- Set up feeds on fine-grained queries (e.g. `t.between.changes`)\r\n- Aggregation feeds (e.g. `t.orderBy.changes`)\r\n- Latency awareness (the `squash` optarg to `changes`)\r\n- Scale your realtime app (a note on scalability and how many feeds a user can open)\r\n- Tutorials (we should rewrite our intro guides to be feed-centric)\r\n\r\n(The tutorials bullet point should probably be a separate ticket.)"
