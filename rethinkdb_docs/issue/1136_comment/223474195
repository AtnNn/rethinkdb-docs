      "I don't particularly care whether we keep the \"is analogous to\" statement. The important thing we need to clarify is that\r\n```\r\ncommand(arg1, arg2, ...)\r\n```\r\nis not generally equivalent to\r\n```\r\ncommand(r.args([arg1, arg2, ...]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt took myself quite a while to figure this out when I first saw https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5821 .\r\n\r\n(and furthermore this is in contrast to `apply` in JavaScript, where this equivalence holds I believe)"
