        "We don't have an explicit way for removing a server anymore.\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/876 is about the case where a server fails and you want to \"clean up\" after it.\r\nHowever there is a separate scenario, where you have a working server that you want to gracefully remove from the cluster, without interrupting availability or losing data.\r\n\r\nApart from the option to manually update all the documents in `table_config` to remove the server from all the `replicas` lists, there is also a second convenient way for removing a given server from all tables by removing the `default` tag, see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2873#issuecomment-157641498\r\n\r\nThis should be documented somewhere."
