        "http://rethinkdb.com/docs/architecture/#query-execution says:\r\n>  If the user runs a query that cannot be executed atomically, by default RethinkDB will throw an error. \r\n\r\nThis is wrong and has lead to misunderstandings like in this answer http://stackoverflow.com/a/31634756/2413884\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this sentence talks about `a query`. However this *only* applies to *functions* passed into `update` and `replace`. It doesn't apply to functions passed into other operations, it doesn't apply to non-update / non-replace queries, and it doesn't apply to non-functions passed into `update` or `replace` (though expressions that involve `r.row` are ok as well, since they are internally turned into functions).\r\n\r\nWe should definitely fix this for 2.1, and probably backport it to the 2.0 docs as well."
