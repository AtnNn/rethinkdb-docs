The interleaving is determined by comparison on the value returned by the lambda function.\r\n* An array of field names\r\n* An array of lambda functions\r\n* `r.desc(field name)` or `r.desc(lambda x: ...)` or `r.desc([field1, field2, ...])` or `r.desc([lambda x: ..., lambda x: ..., ...])`\r\n\r\nFor the last one I'm a little bit fuzzy on whether the `r.desc` must be around the array, or if it can be applied to particular elements inside the array. @nighelles can you clarify please?"
