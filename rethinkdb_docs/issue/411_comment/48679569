      "I have mixed feelings about tweeting things like this. It would be great if we had a highly relevant, technical twitter feed but we currently don't. Until we do, I think too much content like this gives off the wrong vibe, so I'd try to be careful about diluting the little technical content we have with even more non-technical/non-relevant content."
