        "http://rethinkdb.com/docs/elasticsearch/ is overly optimistic right now. It says things like\r\n\"For those applications that need full-text search, we\8217ve got you covered. We\8217ve written a plugin for Elasticsearch (called a river) that keeps RethinkDB synced up with Elasticsearch\8217s indexes\" and doesn't make it obvious that our river plugin has very serious limitations right now.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a big warning in the document. From the \"Caveats\" section of the river plugin README:\r\n> Currently, there's no way to guarantee that no documents are lost if the river loses connection with the RethinkDB server. The only way to be sure is to backfill every time, and this will still miss deleted documents.\r\n\r\nWith RethinkDB 2.2 we will be able to guarantee that no documents are lost (thanks to `return_initial`), but it will still be required to backfill from scratch after every restart.\r\n\r\nAt the moment this solution only works for relatively small data sets (where backfilling/replicating into Elasticsearch from scratch is an option), and where it's ok to have some outdated data in the text index."
