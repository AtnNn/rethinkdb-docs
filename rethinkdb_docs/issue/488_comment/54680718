      ":+1: -- sorry for being a terrible reviewer\r\n\r\nI have two notes:\r\n\r\n- We should title it \"Useful RethinkDB commands for exploring data\" and add it under the title \"Data exploration\" under \"RethinkDB in practice\".\r\n- We should write a blog post summarizing this and linking to the article.\r\n\r\nPlease coordinate with @KittyBot when it's deployed so she can tweet about it, and I'll submit to HN."
