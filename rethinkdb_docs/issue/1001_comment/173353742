      "I don't think that `wait` is particularly useful in the context of `tableCreate`, since `tableCreate` already waits. Or is there an important use case that I'm missing?\r\n\r\nI think it makes a lot of sense to mention next to `reconfigure` and `rebalanace` though, since those commands do *not* wait until the reconfiguration is complete.\r\n\r\nSimilarly we should mention `indexWait` in the `indexCreate` docs, if we're not doing so already."
