        "The `conn.server()` method returns an object `{id: \"<UUID>\", name: <server name>}` with the `id` and `name` of the server that `conn` is connected to.\r\n\r\nThe `server()` method is similar to the `noreplyWait()` method, in that it's not a ReQL command. Instead it's a method you can call on a given connection object. It's synchronous in Python and Ruby, but returns a promise (or alternatively takes a callback) in JavaScript.\r\n\r\nCorresponding server issue: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3934"
