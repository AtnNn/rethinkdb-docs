Or will it collect data from all shards in cluster? > - If only on current, should I start backup process on all servers?\r\n> - Is it slow operation so I should forbid all operation to db while backup in progress?\r\n\r\nThese are all reasonable questions that should be answered by the article itself.\r\n"
