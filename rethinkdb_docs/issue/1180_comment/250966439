      "@danielmewes actually there are two weird errors:\r\n\r\nThere is a missing `[` before `FUNC` it should have two, and there is also a missing `]` at the end. I guess it's \"valid\" syntax to drop these but since the node.js driver emits them and most clients will pair them into a datum array I figure the docs should reflect that?"
