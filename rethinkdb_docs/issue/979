        "http://rethinkdb.com/docs/system-jobs/ briefly mentions terminating queries:\r\n\r\n> The jobs table [...] allows you to kill query jobs by deleting them from the table.\r\n\r\nI think we should elaborate on that a little bit and note that not all queries will terminate immediately. Specifically, many queries will only get terminated the next time they emit a result, but not earlier.\r\nA typical example is `r.table(...).count()`, which will never get terminated before its done, since it only emits a single result at the end.\r\nSee https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5197 for another example."
