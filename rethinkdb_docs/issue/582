        "From an email with @ukd1:\r\n\r\n> [Running the RethinkDB service] gives a message saying to go read the docs. Reading the docs, the bit of interest (quick start) hard to find - it is 7 paras + a long long list of options down the page. \r\n\r\n> It notes: \"The packages do not ship with a default config file\". \r\n\r\n**Here's the problem:**\r\n\r\nWhen you try to start the RethinkDB service (`/etc/init.d/rethinkdb start` or `service rethinkdb start`), but haven't added config files to `/etc/rethinkdb/instances.d`) you see the following message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrethinkdb: No instances defined in /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/\r\nrethinkdb: See http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/guides/startup/ for more information\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error message is bewildering to new users, especially when you click the link and see a long page of various options, rather than a clear guide.\r\n\r\n**We should improve the docs in one (or more) of the following ways:**\r\n\r\n  - We should immediately link to a quickstart section that has clear steps for getting up and running, rather than dumping users on a long document.\r\n  - Even better, rather than link to a document that specifies every option for startup scripts (for every init system, for every platform), we should write a gentle guide that clearly links to a doc with the complete specifications.\r\n\r\n**The quickstart section also uses very negative language.** Example:\r\n\r\n> The packages do not ship with a default config file, so if you install RethinkDB, it will not automatically be run on system startup until you add a config file to /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/.\r\n\r\nThis is equally bewildering (what do you mean RethinkDB doesn't ship with a file you need to accomplish the task you want?) We also do ship an example config file that is easy to get started with -- so we should use positive language, for example:\r\n\r\n> You can set up an init script to automatically run RethinkDB on startup by adding a config file to /etc/rethinkdb/instances.d/.\r\n>\r\n> Copy the example config file and restart the init.d script:\r\n> <continued>\r\n\r\nThis is part of the initial curve when getting up and running with RethinkDB, so it needs some love.\r\n\r\n@chiptole, thoughts?\r\n"
