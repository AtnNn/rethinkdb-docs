      "Is there an output type I should list in the `{% apibody %}` block and the `io` YAML header? I think those are necessary for the building scripts (at least for the data explorer).\r\n\r\nFor `asc` and `desc` we just alias to `order_by`; I'm wondering if we might be better off doing the same for `minval`/`maxval` and `between`."
