      "That is correct - `r.minval` and `r.maxval` are only useful for `between`, but we allow users to put them wherever they want in a query.  `r.asc` and `r.desc` are actually restricted to be the direct descendant of a `order_by` term (which has a few unfortunate side-effects, i.e. rethinkdb/rethinkdb#3188 and rethinkdb/rethinkdb#4143)."
