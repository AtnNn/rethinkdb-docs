        "Having experimented with building secure RethinkDB clusters on AWS, I noted the following details that would be good to document:\r\n\r\n- You can isolate the RethinkDB cluster using a VPC and a security group -- all instances in the cluster need to be sharing the same security group.\r\n- The default security group settings for RethinkDB allows anyone to connect to the database via the driver port, but excludes the intracluster port.\r\n- The documentation for [VPC security groups](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) mentions this important detail:\r\n\r\n> When you specify a security group as the source for a rule, this allows instances associated with the source security group to access instances in the security group. \r\n\r\nThis means you can specify a port range and protocol, and include the security group ID (`sg-<hash>`) to restrict intracluster / driver connections to only nodes within that group.\r\n\r\n- If you're running applications using AWS Elastic Beanstalk (for example, if you want to spin up a set of docker instances) that should have access to the cluster, you can include them in the security group to let them have access to the cluster without requiring a SSH tunnel or a reverse nginx proxy (or any other technique for accessing a cluster behind a firewall).\r\n"
