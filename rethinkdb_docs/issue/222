        "@atnnn I did a little fix in `_scripts/dataexplorer.py`. In some cases, I forgot to reset some flags.\r\nI tested the result, and it works fine now.\r\n\r\nAll the rest is small fixes (like picking the appropriate language to highlight example, adding the missing `io` fields, adding the missing max/min/sum/avg in the index files etc.)\r\n\r\nI also removed the examples for `group`/`ungroup` from the files `index.md` for JavaScript because it was making docs too big for the data explorer.\r\n\r\n@atnnn -- could you do a quick review for me?"
