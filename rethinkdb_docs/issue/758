        "@hamiltop noticed that the docs don't match our server behavior in that http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/min/ and http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/max/ state that \r\n\r\n> a function, to apply the function to every element within the sequence and return the element which returns the smallest value from the function, ignoring any elements where the function returns `null` or produces a non-existence error.\r\n\r\nHowever `null` values aren't currently ignored by the server. We are unsure whether we should change this on the server or not (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4213 ), but for now we should remove the part saying that `null` values are ignored from the API documentation."
