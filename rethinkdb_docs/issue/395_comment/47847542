      "I think having `callback` in the API docs is fine.\r\n\r\nHaving `function(err, result) { ... }` in the cookbook sounds better to me because people can just copy the snippet and just add a `console.log` inside. It also \"easier\" to use/understand than with just `run(conn, callback)`.\r\n\r\nI don't have a really strong opinion about that though."
