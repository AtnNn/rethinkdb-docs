        "Please correct me if I'm wrong on these details -- as I understand it, when we introduced the new admin API, we removed the ability to set split points manually, since it would have complicated the interface. We intend to move to consistent hash sharding, but in the interim, this statement in the [architecture FAQ](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/architecture/) is incorrect:\r\n\r\n> In advanced situations, the user can specify the split points manually, and the system will partition the table into shards according to the user\8217s request. \r\n\r\nWe should revise this to reflect the current state of affairs. Correct?"
