        "@kevincox said this in the original issue (rethinkdb/rethinkdb#620):\r\n\r\n> When selecting and designing with a database it is important to know the cost of \r\n> what queries in what situations. For example, it is often reasonable to use a \r\n> quadratic query, if you know the size of your dataset will be under a certain size.\r\n\r\n> It would be very useful to have the expected time complexities of the queries in the \r\n> documentation and the cases for which the complexity will be different. This is \r\n> something that [Redis does really well](http://redis.io/commands/ltrim) for example.\r\n\r\nThis was met with complete agreement by everyone involved."
