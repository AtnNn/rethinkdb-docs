      "There are two things with `make install` which would justify not adding it for now\r\n- There is no `uninstall` rule at the moment\r\n- It's platform dependent (would it only because all distribution don't use init scripts)\r\n- Building RethinkDB from source and installing it means that you want to live on the edge, in which case you tend to use distributions like Gentoo or Arch, but not really Ubuntu -- but it seems that you are a Ubuntu user who compiled/installed from source so that may not a valid reason.\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong opinion on `make install`, but I would feel comfortable not talking about it for now.\r\n\r\nWhat's sure is that the build instructions need to be updated (we are missing libtermcap)"
