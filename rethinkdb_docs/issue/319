        "Here is one of the examples in the `withFields` api docs:\r\n\r\n> Get a list of heroes and their nemeses, excluding any heroes whose nemesis isn't in an evil organization.\r\n> \r\n> ```javascript\r\nr.table('marvel').withFields('id', {'nemesis' : {'evil_organization' : true}})\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirstly, the description is wrong (I think?). It says \"whose nemesis isn't in an evil organization\"  but then we search for documents whose nemesis has a field \"evil_organization\". That's confusing.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the whole darn example is ridiculous. I can barely follow what it means. We can find an example that's 100x more relevant and clear (for example, find all records where the `city` subfield of `address` is filled in)."
