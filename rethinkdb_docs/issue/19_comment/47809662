      "It looks like the general consensus was to document `r.any` and `r.all` for Python and Ruby, but note that they're deprecated in favor of `r.or(_)` and `r.and(_)`. Is that right? And `any` and `all` are prefix commands rather than infix, so: `r.any(True,False)` rather than `r,.expr(True).or(False)`?"
