      "Just to follow up on my comments in the `coerce_to` review, I would say here that all values except `null` and `false` are *converted* to true when used in a boolean context.  In my mind, conversion is when a type changes implicitly, and coercion is when you explicitly ask for a type to change (e.g. by calling `coerce_to`)."
