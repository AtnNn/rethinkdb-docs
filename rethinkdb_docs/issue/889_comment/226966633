      "Been digging into the documentation recently and what I'm trying to understand is that given a table or two tables, certain operations/queries produce a certain result.  \r\n\r\nThe process of assembling a mental model of how all the pieces work together would be greatly aided by a single complex data structure that I could reference. The various table and model structures - blogs, marvel heroes, users, etc - just add another layer of complexity. One data structure able to be referenced from any query/transformation code sample would help a lot. "
