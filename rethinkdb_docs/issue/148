        "Here are some questions that often come up:\r\n\r\n* if one runs rethinkdb on multiple nodes, is fault tolerance built in?\r\n* can i read/write to various nodes at the same time?\r\n* is rethinkdb eventually-consistent?\r\n* is multi-datacenter replication supported?\r\n* can insertion/deletion/reads be done on separate nodes?\r\n* can insertion/deletion/reads be done on separate nodes during network partitioning?\r\n* what happens when a master dies? does it automatically pick a new master?\r\n* what happens when the master comes back up?\r\n\r\nWe already have the answers in http://rethinkdb.com/docs/architecture/, but it takes some reading to get to them. We should have a more straight forward faq/answers to these questions so we don't have to answer them over and over again."
