However we might want to change the names of these error types a bit before the final release. Also note that this isn't implemented in the Python driver yet.\r\n\r\nWe need to document these new error types and their type hierarchy somewhere. Any suggestions for a suitable place to put these?\r\n\r\n(http://docs.rethinkdb.com/2.1/docs/consistency/ also currently states \"you can examine the error message\", which we should change to checking the error type)"
