      "> Why can't you chain an orderBy with an index after getAll?\r\n\r\nJust because we haven't implemented it yet.\r\n\r\n> Also, the error message you get is \"RqlRuntimeError: Indexed order_by can only be performed on a TABLE\", but your second comment suggests that this isn't actually the case?\r\n\r\nThis is a flaw in our type system right now: `r.table('test').between(0, 1).typeof.run => \"TABLE\"`.  (Which is why you can chain an `order_by` after a `between`.)"
