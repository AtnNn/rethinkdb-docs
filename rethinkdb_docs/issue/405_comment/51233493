      "Why *can't* you chain an `orderBy` with an index after `getAll`? I think we should add a little more to the article than just \"this doesn't work,\" and this may be something we need to add to the `orderBy` article.\r\n\r\nAlso, the error message you get is \"RqlRuntimeError: Indexed order_by can only be performed on a TABLE\", but your second comment suggests that this isn't actually the case?"
