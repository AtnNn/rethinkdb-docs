      "I think we need a new type in our type system.  `between` should return something halfway between a table and a selection (I've proposed TABLE_SLICE in the past).  So `between` currently can take a table and return a \"table\", but the second table isn't quite the same as most tables (e.g. you can't call `between` on it again).  So there's really no good way to document this right now; I would continue to lie and say that `between` returns a selection in the docs, and mention that an indexed `order_by` can be chained after a `between` as a special case."
