      "The docs for `between` say it should return a selection, which I didn't think could be a table. Are there are any other commands this happens for, and is it something we should really have in the documentation? I was planning to address this by writing \"Currently, you cannot chain an `orderBy` using a secondary index after a `getAll` but only after a `table` (or another command that returns the `TABLE` data type)\" as one of the limitations, but would that be describing correct behavior, or describing current but incorrect-and-to-be-fixed behavior?"
