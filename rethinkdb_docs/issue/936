        "I'm running RethinkDB 2.1.5 on an Arch Linux server and then locally on my Mac. I get back different results, though, when I run this code:\r\n```\r\nr.table('module')\r\n  .get(moduleId)('gpsLocation')\r\n  .distance(r.point(long, lat))\r\n```\r\nwith r.point(long,lat) equalling the coordinates on 'gpsLocation', the distance returned is 0 on one server (local), but a negative number e on the other (Arch Linux). This happens whether I run the code through my app or if I do the equivalent query in the Data Explorer. \r\n\r\nWhat makes it return one vs the other? And is there a way to control what it returns?"
