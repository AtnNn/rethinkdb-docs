      "This came up specifically because of [this tweet](https://twitter.com/brwnll/status/413090236374061056):\r\n\r\n> @rethinkdb DataExplorer\r\nr.db(\"db\").table(\"tbl\").index_list();\r\nTypeError: has no method 'index_list'. Expected? bit.ly/1bcIg6y\r\n\r\nObviously, the secondary indexes docs were confusing.... because the primary interface baked into the product didn't support the queries mentioned in the documentation. That seems like a bad thing.\r\n\r\nLanguage superiority is good and all, but if the Data Explorer uses JavaScript, we need to either do multi-language docs or JavaScript."
