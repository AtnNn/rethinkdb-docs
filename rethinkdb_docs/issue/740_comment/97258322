      "`distinct` on a table isn't a no-op; it turns it from a table into a stream (so you can't do `table.distinct.get` for example).  But, yes, it doesn't change the content of the stream at all, and it isn't really useful; we just support it because we wanted `distinct` to be defined on all streams."
