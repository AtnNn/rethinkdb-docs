      "Okay, if we're going to add this to the signature for `between` the only way to do it is to show it taking table_slice, which means that we're going to have document table_slice as a RethinkDB-specific data type which (if I understand it correctly) behaves like a selection to every command that expects a selection. `between` can take either a table or a table slice but nothing else. Is it worth editing the API signature for `between` and `order_by` to reflect that they do *not* return \"selection\" but actually return \"table_slice\"?"
