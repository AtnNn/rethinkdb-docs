      "Ah, ok I just noticed this note at the bottom:\r\n\r\n> Note: If you chain between after order_by, the between command must use the index specified in order_by, and will default to that index. Trying to specify another index will result in a ReqlRuntimeError.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like this is a special case just for orderBy. In that case I think we should have at least one example, and the signature should reflect this fact"
