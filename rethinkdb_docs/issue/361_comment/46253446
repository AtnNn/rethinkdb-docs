      "@grandquista Because the u'str' notation was introduced in Python 3.3, right? Well, personally I think Python 3.3 is the first \"stable\" version in the 3 series, because of its compatibility features. It has been almost two years since the release of 3.3, so we can just set the minimum requirement to 3.3... Will there be a problem? Many libraries I have seen also require >=3.3.\r\n\r\nIf we're going >=3.3, we have to state the required version on somewhere."
