        "Some functions like merge do not take an anonymous function, so while people seems to easily find about map, they don't really know what to do when they get a single document (after `.get()` for example).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nr.table(\"foo\").get(1).do( function(doc) {\r\n    return doc.merge( {\r\n        newIdName: doc(\"id\")\r\n    }).without(\"id\")\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can do two things to improve the docs here:\r\n- Update the related commands in `map` and mention `do`.\r\n- Improve the doc for `do` and explain when `do` can be useful\r\n\r\nNote: The example for the `do` command uses a prefix notation, while the backtrace does not (at least in JavaScript). We should change that.\r\n\r\nThen we can pay attention when adding examples that use `map` and try to write the equivalent queries with a `do`.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1732"
