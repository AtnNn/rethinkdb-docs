      "@neumino -- I would remove the commands. We still have a lot to accomplish, and I think it's too early to accumulate cruft. If someone gets confused, we can link them to the migration gist. I wouldn't create maintenance work for ourselves where it isn't necessary. If people start thinking of RethinkDB as \"these folks are top-notch technically and build an awesome product, but the bastards break compatibility all the time\", I'd be ok with that. (For now. Of course eventually we'll have to be a lot more careful, I just don't think it's time for that yet)"
