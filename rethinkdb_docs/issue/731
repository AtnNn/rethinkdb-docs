See Github issue https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/955 to track progress.\"\r\n\r\nThis is no longer true. We've implemented `r.minval/r.maxval`, as well as openness and closeness in `between`. The doc should be updated (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/955 for how users can use `between` to query compound indexes by prefix).\r\n\r\n/cc @chipotle "
