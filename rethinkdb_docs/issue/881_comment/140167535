      "Also, I think I might need a little clarification with the bit about the `db` global optarg. This can only be specified in `db`, `run` and `connect`, right? And `connect` and `run` aren't commands that get serialized. If you specify `r.table('users').run(db='blog')` does that get serialized as if it was `r.db('blog').table('users')`?"
