      "The global optargs get sent to the server pretty much the way they're specified (as a json object at the protocol level) except that the value of the `db` key can't just be a string specifying the name of the db to use, it has to be a serialized db object, so `{db: \"foo\"}` gets automatically translated by the js/py drivers into `{db: [14 [\"foo\"]]}`. (14 is the id of the `DB` ast object)"
