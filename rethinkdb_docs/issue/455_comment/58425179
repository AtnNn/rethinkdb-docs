      "I'm not sure I understand this -- if the split point is going to be the string value 'n', for instance, the proper syntax is `rethinkdb admin split shard da2cde32-2052-4a7f-a53f-2522be15a59f Sn`?\r\n\r\nThe command won't give you an error if the split point is *not* prefixed with 'S', so it's not very clear. (Also, the documentation doesn't really tell you that the split point is supposed to be a value in the primary key field, so that should probably be clarified.)"
