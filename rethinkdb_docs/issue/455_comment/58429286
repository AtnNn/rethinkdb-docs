      "@chipotle Yes, your example is correct.\r\n\r\n\"rethinkdb admin\" doesn't give an error because it's basically broken in that respect (it should, but I think it doesn't actually understand what the split points mean). This will be fixed in 1.17 with the introduction of the ReQL-based administration interface.\r\n\r\nFor now I think we should just update the docs accordingly, without spending too much effort in it."
