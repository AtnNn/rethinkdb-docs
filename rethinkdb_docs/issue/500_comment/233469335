      "@danielmewes it is option 2, it call Thinky function and so it is executed no matter what.\r\n\r\nTwo quick questions:\r\n- If I called a regular ReQL query in `>>[save]`, would `r.do / r.branch` be the recommended pattern (aka *rethinkdb way*) for these uniqueness checks?\r\n- I know Thinky is not officially supported, but any clue on why this work this way and how could I use Thinky following the recommended pattern would be deeply appreciated."
