        "For http://rethinkdb.com/docs/map-reduce/, we originally expected people to read up on map/reduce elsewhere, but it turns out people don't like that (one data point for that is here https://juristat.com/a-comparison-of-mongodb-and-rethinkdb-with-patent-data/). We should add more map/reduce examples to that page so people have a good idea of how to use the functions.\r\n\r\n(We can look at canonical hadoop/mongo GMR examples, and adapt them to RethinkDB). I think just 3-5 additional examples would make a lot of difference."
