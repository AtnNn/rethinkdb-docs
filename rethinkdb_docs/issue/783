        "Currently, the only way to clearly see the driver language is to 1. read the URL or 2. go up to the page and see the selected language. I think these are both sub-optimal. You can, of course, actually read the code, but it's so similar across language that it might be confusing and trip up beginners (I'm creating this issue after talking to a user that went through this!). I'm also usually interested in seeing the documentation for a particular language, and it should be clear that I'm in the incorrect language documentation in order to switch quickly to the desired one.\r\n\r\nKeep in min that google arbitrarily chooses which language to show for a particular method, so you can never really predict what language you're getting when googling something.\r\n\r\nHere are some suggestions for possibly visually differentiating which driver you're currently on. Obviously, I have no knowledge of the documentation system and how it works, so I understand that these might be hard to implement. These are only suggestions and can be disregarded if it doesn't end up making much sense.\r\n\r\n1. Add a language logo or name to the background of the code sample. This *might* be easy to do.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2015-06-02 at 6 59 50 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1981198/7951207/a2b38800-0959-11e5-9945-b00350a013ba.png)\r\n\r\n(There's probably a much better way of executing this :smile: )\r\n\r\n2. Have a code switcher in all code snippets with all relevant languages. Stripe uses this on some of its documentation.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2015-06-02 at 7 05 19 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1981198/7951296/c107fcb8-095a-11e5-8ea7-99e2f2069761.png)\r\n\r\n3.
