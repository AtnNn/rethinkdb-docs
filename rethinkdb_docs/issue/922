        "http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/migration/ says:\r\n> Starting with version 1.13 of RethinkDB, manual migration of data when upgrading between major versions (1.x \8594 1.y) is no longer necessary. \r\n\r\nHowever we dropped support for directly upgrading from RethinkDB 1.13 to RethinkDB 2.1.x. In that case, users first need to migrate to RethinkDB 2.0.5, rebuild all of their secondary indexes, and then in a second step migrate to RethinkDB 2.1.x.\r\n\r\nWe should document these steps.\r\nThis came up in a Google Groups question here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rethinkdb/xLi_EmSdYBI\r\n\r\nFor 1.14 and onwards, the upgrade is still fully automatic as of RethinkDB 2.1, though RethinkDB 2.2 will no longer support direct upgrades from 1.14 and 1.15 anymore."
