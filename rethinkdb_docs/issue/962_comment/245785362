      "It would also be great to see some recommendations on starting the proxy and restarting it if the process dies or if the server is rebooted. Looking at https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5138 there's a suggestion that this can be done by editing the init script. Not being an expert on this I wasn't that confident to jump into /etc/init.d/rethinkdb and start messing around. I ended up using Upstart instead of altering the init script. I wrote up [some notes](https://medium.com/@brucepomeroy/running-a-rethinkdb-proxy-on-ubuntu-68f8cd308b7b#.vd1qqp66u) as I couldn't find an explanation anywhere of how to do this. I'd welcome feedback on the approach I'm certainly not experienced with this."
