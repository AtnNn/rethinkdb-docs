      "There's a comment in that link after yours which does multiple aggregations by wrapping them in `r.object`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nr.object(\r\n    'average_time',\r\n    r.table('data')('time').avg(),\r\n    'total_votes',\r\n    r.table('data')('votes').sum()\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre there any pitfalls with that? I get that map-reduce is very powerful, but I think usability and query readability is vastly improved when it can be avoided."
