        "It is usually advisable to give `rethinkdb` multiple `--join` arguments, one for each other server in the cluster.\r\nThat way, if one other server is down when restarting a RethinkDB node, it will still be able to connect to the cluster rather than waiting (possibly forever) for that one server to come up.\r\n\r\nA RethinkDB server started with multiple `--join` options will become available once it's able to connect to at least one of them. If it can't connect to any of the listed servers, it will stay in a partially available state and keep trying to connect. In this state it can respond to incoming *cluster* connections from other nodes, but will not accept any client connections nor process queries.\r\n\r\nhttp://rethinkdb.com/docs/start-a-server/ might be the best way to put this (under \"A RethinkDB cluster using multiple machines\").\r\n\r\nThis came up on our community Slack channel."
