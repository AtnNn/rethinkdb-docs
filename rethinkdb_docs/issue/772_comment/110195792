      "We should explain non-voting replicas more clearly. https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/770#issuecomment-110194224 describes what the meaning of a \"non-voting\" replica is. The main reason to make a replica non-voting is to reduce latency if the replica is located in a faraway datacenter. One might want to set all of the replicas in one data center as voting, but all replicas in other datacenters as non-voting, so that their increased latencies don't slow down queries."
