      "Thanks, I totally missed that there were other branches waiting for release.\r\nIs it a conscious decision to not include the Jekyll configurations with the custom tags in the repo? I couldn't figure out how to render the docs locally, it throws an error as soon as it encounters an `infobox` tag.\r\n\r\nThanks, I've loved the quality of the documentation and using RethinkDB so far. I'll be sure to fill out the CLA."
