      "@natebrennand -- thanks for the pull request, and we hope you keep contributing! To chime in on @neumino's comments, we have a complex build system that starts with Jekyll to build the complete website.\r\n\r\nI completely agree that not being able to render docs locally is a barrier to contributing. I started (and will soon finish) having a minimal version that builds locally in the `mg_preview` branch (may currently be broken)."
