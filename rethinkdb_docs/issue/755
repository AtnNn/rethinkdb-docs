        "The [JavaScript ten minute guide](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/guide/javascript/) recommends doing this to open a connection:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar connection = null;\r\nr.connect( {host: 'localhost', port: 28015}, function(err, conn) {\r\n    if (err) throw err;\r\n    connection = conn;\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat code has a bug when not used in the REPL: the connection is open asynchronously.\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful to have a similar example but with code that can be pasted into a script, especially for users who aren't too familiar with promises or asynchronous programming."
