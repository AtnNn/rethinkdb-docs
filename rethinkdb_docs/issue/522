        "Here http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/get_nearest/ the sentence\r\n> This command returns the same results as `table.filter(r.row('index').intersects(geometry)).`\r\n\r\nis wrong. It applies to get_intersecting, but not to get_nearest. The equivalent query for `get_nearest` would involve a map and an orderBy using `r.distance`, but I don't think we actually have to mention it here.\r\n\r\n> The total number of results is limited to the array size limit which defaults to 100,000, but can be changed with the arrayLimit option to run.\r\n\r\nThis could be misleading because `get_nearest` also has the `max_results` opt arg, which is usually the limiting factor. The fact that it's also limited by the array size limit already follows from the fact that it returns an array, and I don't think we have to mention that here.\r\n\r\nPing @chipotle "
