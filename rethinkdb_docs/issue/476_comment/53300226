      "If these feeds are what's produced by [changes](http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/changes/), then don't they return a `cursor`? If that's the case, doesn't having `cursor` in the API signature for `each` cover this? AFAIK, `feed` isn't its own data type; it's a stream (albeit an infinite one)."
