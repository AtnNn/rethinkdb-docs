        "Something that I've seen a few times is when a user create a function and \r\n\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'do'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically will do something like\r\n```py\r\ndef reql_cos(x)\r\n  return x.do(lamba x: ... ))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich throws if you call `reql_cos` with a float and not a ReQL term.\r\n\r\nThe proper way to define a function that may take non reql terms as arguments is to wrap them in `r.expr`\r\nSomething like\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef reql_cos(x)\r\n  return r.expr(x).do(lamba x: ... ))\r\n```\r\n"
