      "I suggest that we add a note to the `db` API page http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/db/ about the alternative way of selecting a DB by setting the default DB during connection setup or through `use`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we mention the option of passing a db as a global optarg anywhere right now, and I'm undecided on whether we should include it in the documentation or not (though I suspect the answer is yes)."
