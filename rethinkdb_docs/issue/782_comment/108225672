      "@danielcompton -- that's accurate.  The global `db` optarg is only used if you write `r.table` instead of `r.db(...).table`.\r\n\r\nIn general I would strongly advise against running untrusted queries right now.  (After https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/218 or a similar issue gets in it will be a lot safer.)"
