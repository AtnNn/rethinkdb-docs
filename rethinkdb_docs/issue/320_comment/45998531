I'm not sure whether or not I'm happy with it -- I think it's a little confusing, but it isn't worse than our old driver docs, and making it non-confusing would probably be a bit of work (and produce a much longer document that goes into detail on the translation between the query a user types and the protobuf that should be produced)."
