See rethinkdb/rethinkdb#3992.\r\n\r\nNote that this will either not happen for 2.1, or it will happen in a way which we wouldn't want to document. So as far as the 2.1 documentation is concerned, those operations are definitely not guaranteed to be atomic as a whole (and it's unclear if that will change)."
