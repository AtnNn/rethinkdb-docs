        "We should write how to do efficient pagination (in the cookbook?). The `skip` command has linear performance on the number of skipped documents, so people should rely on between/orderBy.\r\n\r\nAn efficient way to do pagination is to pass the last element printed, and retrieve the next ones with `between` and `orderBy`.\r\nSee https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3105#issuecomment-57191079\r\n\r\n"
