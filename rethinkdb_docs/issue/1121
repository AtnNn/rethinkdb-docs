        "There's a list \"Commands that stop subsequent commands from being parallelized include:\" at https://rethinkdb.com/docs/optimization/\r\n\r\nThe list is not exhaustive (which is why it's saying \"include\"), but we should add a few additional terms to not mislead users into thinking that they can use alternative terms to avoid this restriction.\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\"`limit`\" -> \"`limit`, `skip`, `slice`\"\r\n\"`reduce`\" -> \"`reduce`, `fold`\"\r\n\r\nWe should also add `eqJoin` to the list, since its new implementation since RethinkDB 2.3 no longer allows parallelization of subsequent terms as far as I know."
