There are two formats we support, whitespace is ignored in both formats:\r\n\r\n* An array of JSON documents\r\n  * This means the file begins and ends with `[` and `]`, and each row is separated by a comma.\r\n* Whitespace-separated JSON rows\r\n  * Each row is a dict, and so begins and ends with `{` and `}`"
