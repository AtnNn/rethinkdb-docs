      "I've done a search through the documentation and this seems to mostly be mentioned where it needs to be. One thing I did notice, though: `without`, `pluck`, `withFields` and `hasFields` don't let you pass in functions. I'm not sure whether that's a problem in their use cases, but if each command really should support the first two syntaxes in the last comment, that might be a bug.\r\n\r\nI'll open a code review with `orderBy`, `innerJoin` and `outerJoin`, which are the ones I found that needed these examples."
