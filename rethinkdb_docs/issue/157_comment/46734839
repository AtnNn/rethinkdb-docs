      "I think having a section \"filtering\" is useful because it's a common task, and that's what we've been calling it.  I wouldn't be opposed to having a separate section on nested field syntax since it's supported in other places, but that syntax never gets turned into an equality predicate anywhere except inside a `filter`, so the part of the docs explaining how a nested object gets turned into an equality predicate makes sense inside the `filter` section."
