        "- Add a style to split description from example or group the description at the top.\r\n- We should mention that `sum` is not going to concatenate strings.\r\n- ~~It would be better to have a full dataset and show the full results instead of having some `...` everywhere~~\r\n- For `avg`, it would be nice to have the input/output\r\n- I really don't like `frozenset` in Python. I would like to push this example further down in the docs.\r\n\r\nExtras stuff -- I may open a new issue later for them\r\n- `contains` deserve a better example. Many people use it as a `or`\r\n- Improve `concat_map`\r\n\r\n"
