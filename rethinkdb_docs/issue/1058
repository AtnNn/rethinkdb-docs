        "RethinkDB 2.3 will come with a new driver protocol handshake. So the \"Perform a handshake\" section of http://rethinkdb.com/docs/writing-drivers/ will need to be updated.\r\n\r\nThe new protocol handshake is described here: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5406#issuecomment-185980303 , though the actual magic number is going to be `0x34c2bdc3` in step 1.\r\n\r\nThe details of the authentication are missing in the spec from the issue.\r\n@VeXocide could you describe the missing parts here please?\r\n\r\nThere is a \"simplified\" path through the handshake steps, which you get from going sequentially through the steps 1 to 7. Specifically you can ignore the note \"Client proceeds to step 3 to reduce latency.\" in step 1, and instead wait for the response the server sends in step 2. This allows the client to go immediately to step 5, and then back to step 3. In this case, step 5 will only be entered once.\r\nThis is probably easier to explain in person, so @chipotle please let me know when you want to take a look at this.\r\n\r\nI think we should explain that simplified protocol path, and then provide the details of the optimized one as an optional optimization (it reduces latency because the client doesn't have to wait on the server response from step 2)."
