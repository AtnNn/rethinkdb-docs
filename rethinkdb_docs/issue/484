        "@timjrobinson wrote in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2956:\r\n> I can't find any documentation on how to properly run a cluster of 2+ nodes with rethinkdb. Should I just set them up and make clients connect to the first server? Or should I use a loadbalancer such as HAProxy or nginx in front of the cluster and go through that? If I should be using a loadbalancer what settings should I be specifying for maximum performance?\r\n> \r\n> It would be good to have a doc that explains even the basics of how this should be setup. If you could point me to any docs related to this it would be much appreciated.\r\n"
