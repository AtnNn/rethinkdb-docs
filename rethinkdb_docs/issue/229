        "@atnnn -- can you take a quick look?\r\n\r\nFor `filter`, we used to have the description of the `Joins` api section. This commit fixes that.\r\nI also tried the output with 1.12 in the data explorer, and everything seems to work.\r\n\r\nOnce you merged it, you can regenerate the `reql_docs.json` file, and push it to the rethinkdb repo.\r\nAnd that should close https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1982"
