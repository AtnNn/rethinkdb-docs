They're both called `SERVER_INFO`, a `SERVER_INFO` query always returns a `SERVER_INFO` response, and the format of the response is otherwise identical to that of a `SUCCESS_ATOM` response.\r\n\r\n(Also, as an aside, it looks like we don't list the different `QueryType`s anywhere on that page; only the different `ResponseType`s.  We should consider fixing that.)"
