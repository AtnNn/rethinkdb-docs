      "This is not in the [example projects](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/examples/) page anymore, and as far as I remember the `examples` directory is actually deprecated. I suspect the issue here isn't that this example is missing the sidebar as much as that this example shouldn't still be linked anywhere."
