Currently RethinkDB does not enforce UTF-8 encoding, but most string operations assume they are operating on UTF-8 strings. Future versions of RethinkDB will enforce UTF-8 encoding and allow null to be included.\r\n\r\nThis has since changed. The RethinkDB server now *does* enforce UTF-8 encoding, and null characters *are* allowed.\r\n\r\nThe only limitation is that null characters are still not allowed in primary key strings. This page is probably not the right place to mention that though."
