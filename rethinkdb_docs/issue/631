        "I think cluster management docs could get a lot better. For example, I couldn't find references to `stats`, `server_status`, and `jobs` tables in the doc articles. I think we should add an \"Operation\" section, and in that section have the following articles:\r\n\r\n- Cluster configuration\r\n- Sharding and replication\r\n- Monitoring (which would contain info about status tables and stats)\r\n- Job control\r\n- Best practices\r\n\r\nWe're going to do a big doc reorg for 2.0, so putting this into the 2.0 milestone. I'll grab @chipotle and possibly a few more people next week and we'll come up with a new doc structure that we can viably ship by 2.0."
