        "Hey guys, so sorry if this is the wrong place, but I suspect there might be a few others with the same thoughts. I absolutely love the new look to the site \8211 and congrats on the 2.0 launch!! \8211 but I really miss the scrolling sidebar from the old API documentation. It was so attractive and useful that I would literally bring people to the site just to show off the well thought-out scrolling behavior.\r\n\r\nWhile this new design clearly has awesome new features, particularly in that seamless transition between individual mobile pages and the single scrollable main page (I will probably be bringing people here to show them that now...) I really miss that old sidebar on large screens.\r\n\r\nIs there any chance we could get that back?\r\n\r\nYou guys rock!"
