      "Maybe we could add small icons to the sections that represent the major distributions for which the instructions apply? Probably for all the distributions that we list here http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/ ?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Ubuntu seems important enough to add an explicit warning box to the `systemd` section follow the `init.d` instructions instead on Ubuntu."
