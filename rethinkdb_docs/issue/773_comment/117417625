      "In addition to the \"Availability and failover\" section being out of date, there are some smaller things that need to be updated:\r\n* In the event of a netsplit, what matters is which side of the netsplit has a majority of voters, not which side has the primary replica.\r\n* RethinkDB now uses the Raft protocol instead of semilattices to store and propagate cluster configuration in most cases, but we still use semilattices in a few situations. When we do use semilattices, we use timestamps rather than vector clocks."
