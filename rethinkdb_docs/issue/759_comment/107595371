      "The \"[Changefeeds in RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/changefeeds/ruby/)\" article lists the commands you can append `changes` to. That might be what you're looking for?\r\n\r\nI'll check on that comment, but i'm pretty sure you're right -- we should go through all the examples for `changes`, because they were written for the first version of changefeeds and there's probably a few others which show more convoluted examples than we need now. I'll open a new issue about that."
