      "I think the docs need to explain what kind of streams `changes` works on (I didn't realize 2.0 started allowing them on `getAll` until I read the changelog). Also, I think the body of the text needs some updates:\r\n\r\n>```js\r\n// Note that this will have to look at and discard all the changes to\r\n// rows besides Bob's.  This is currently no way to filter with an index\r\n// on changefeeds.\r\nr.table('test').changes().filter(r.row('new_val')('name').eq('Bob')).run(conn, callback)\r\n```"
