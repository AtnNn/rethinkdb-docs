        "@dalanmiller - I figured I'd tag you for the review of this. This changes the Go icon on the Install Client Drivers page to be the quasi-official Go gopher per #981.\r\n\r\nThis is taken from Go's front page, colored the way I sometimes see the gopher colored. I don't _love_ it but it seems okay. I think making a better icon at a smaller size will require redrawing it from scratch.\r\n\r\nYes, the PNG file is optimized. :)"
