      "I think breaking it out makes sense. I've always found it a bit odd that the configuration options were described as part of the \"Create a cluster on system startup\" page.\r\n\r\n(Another thing is that the \"Create a cluster on startup\" title is a bit odd, because it also applies if I only want to start a single server. Also we don't really \"create\" the cluster on startup, we just start it. I think you had already addressed that in your proposal for an improved documentation structure though?)"
