      "@chipotle One more thing I forgot about: All drivers now accept two new options to their `connect` method. `user` with a username, and `password` for the password (both strings). The defaults are `user = \"admin\"` and `password = \"\"`.\r\n@deontologician Can you clarify how you implemented the user/password API in the Java driver?"
