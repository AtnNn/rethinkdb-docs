      "> Currently some commands have the full set of options in the syntax (e.g. `insert`), and others don't (e.g. `connect` or `run`). I assume this is depending on how many options there are for the particular command.\r\n\r\nYep. There's no hard and fast rule for this, but once a command gets more than three or four options I tend to take them out of the API header. There's only about a half-dozen commands that this is the case for. The API header for `run` if we documented everything would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nquery.run(conn[, read_mode=\"single\", time_format=\"native\", profile=False,\r\ndurability=\"soft\", group_format=\"native\", noreply=False, db=\"test\",\r\narray_limit=100000, binary_format=\"native\", min_batch_rows=8,\r\nmax_batch_rows=<unlimited>, max_batch_seconds=0.5,\r\nfirst_batch_scaledown_factor=4]) \8594 cursor\r\nquery.run(conn[, read_mode=\"single\", time_format=\"native\", profile=False,\r\ndurability=\"soft\", group_format=\"native\", noreply=False, db=\"test\",\r\narray_limit=100000, binary_format=\"native\", min_batch_rows=8,\r\nmax_batch_rows=<unlimited>, max_batch_seconds=0.5,\r\nfirst_batch_scaledown_factor=4]) \8594 object\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and while this is admittedly the worst case to pick, I'm not convinced this would aid clarity. I could be convinced otherwise, but we have a couple commands that get into the 6+ option range\8212and sometimes have more than one form, like `run` here, and thus have to be repeated for each form.\r\n"
