I wasn't aware that we were doing this.\r\n\r\n@chipotle for the moment, the API documentation for `between` needs to be adapted slightly. http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/between/ It's currently saying \"(it uses the primary key by default)\", so there should be a note that it uses the index of a preceding `orderBy` instead if there is one."
