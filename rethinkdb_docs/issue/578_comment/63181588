      "Hey guys\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to add RethinkDB's documentation to DevDocs. The CC BY-SA license is perfect.\r\n\r\n> We might also have to do some format conversion on the API docs for DevDocs\r\n\r\nThe build process isn't standardized (yet). At the moment DevDocs is just a collection of scrapers that I maintain and update on a regular basis. Since your docs have good markup, headings, and URLs, it shouldn't be too hard to add them.\r\n\r\n> and we should check that we're able to efficiently maintain our docs there when we release updates.\r\n\r\nI do a batch of updates every week-end. If the markup of the source doesn't change significantly it takes just one command to update the docs.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want me to create the scraper (a [donation](https://gratipay.com/Thibaut/) is appreciated but not required ;))."
