        "Currently it looks like we are going to ship RethinkDB 2.0 with single document change feeds (aka point change feeds).\r\n\r\nThat is you will be able to run\r\n`r.table('t').get('id1234').changes()`\r\nand get a stream that sends you the latest version of the document with the primary key 'id1234' whenever it changes. In addition, it sends you the current version of the document once at the beginning.\r\n\r\n@mlucy Is there support for the \"send_initial\" opt arg in the implementation that's in v1.15.x and next?\r\n\r\nWe have to document this, at least as part of the API documentation for the `changes` term.\r\n\r\nIt is still uncertain whether we will ship only this change on top of 1.15, or if we will actually include all the other changes that are already in our `next` branch (such as `r.range()` or the multi-stream `map`). So any work on this should be done in a branch of its own that's branched off the 1.15 version of the docs, so we can release this doc update independently of the other ones if necessary."
