      ". @mlucy pointed out that our actual implementation has a few differences to what is described in https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5406#issuecomment-185980303 when it comes to how the authentication data is encoded. He also pointed out that we should probably document the format of the `nonce` we are using (18 (*edit*) random bytes base64 encoded).\r\n\r\n@chipotle I recommend waiting for @VeXocide to fill in the details of the actual protocol on this one."
