        "As of the time of this writing, it's here -- https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/mlucy_proto_docs/src/rdb_protocol/ql2_json.md, but will be on the site soon.\r\n\r\nHere are some things that need to be improved:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Section 2 (the query) needs to be expanded. Right now it's as long as section 1 (the handshake), but the mechanics are significantly more complicated, and we let people guess a lot. In particular, we should have a few more progressively more complex examples (start with r.expr(1) and show how to use lambdas and such), and explain how the json protocol related to protobufs a bit better. For example, we link to the protobuf spec, but don't even say that you're supposed to use the integer values defined there explicitly.\r\n- [ ] Add a section at the end that gives people some friendly notion on how to get started. For example, we should explicitly link to the official drivers, and a few community drivers source code."
