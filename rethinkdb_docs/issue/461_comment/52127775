      "Can I take this issue? I would like to reorganise the build instructions on the website. Here's what I'm proposing:\r\n\r\nRemove the build from source instructions on the individual distro pages and merge them into a single \"build from source\" page. This page will\r\n* have a list of dependencies for each distro\r\n* have a single build instructions section\r\n* use the source distribution (instead of a shallow clone of the PR branch)\r\n* not pass `--fetch` or `--allow-fetch` flags to `./configure` (the source distribution contains the v8 source and pre-compiled web assets, so all dependencies should be available)\r\n\r\nAdd a \"hacking on rethinkdb\" page that will\r\n* lists all build dependencies and their equivalent packages on ubuntu\r\n* use a git clone of next\r\n* use `--allow-fetch`\r\n* have links to the community, CLA and build from source pages and to the contribution guidelines"
