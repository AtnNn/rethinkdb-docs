        "A few versions ago we added a `bracket` term, that supersedes both `get_field` and `nth`.\r\n\r\nThe documentation still calls `()` and `[]` `get_field` (http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/get_field/)\r\n\r\nIt should perhaps be renamed to `bracket`, and mention that it accepts array offsets as an argument, just like `nth`."
