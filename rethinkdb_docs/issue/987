        "As of rethinkdb/rethinkdb#4227, `slice` supports being applied to string values, with the indexes representing unicode codepoints.\r\n\r\nFor example, `r.expr(\"\12371\12435\12395\12385\12399\").slice(2,1)` returns `\"\12395\"`. Note that combining codepoints are counted separately, just like with string `.count()`. Negative and missing indexes and the `leftBound` and `rightBound` optargs are handled in a way equivalent with the rest of the types."
