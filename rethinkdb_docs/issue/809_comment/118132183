      "If it's too big I'll resize it -- it's better to be too big than too small in this case. :) The CSS resizes them all to the proper dimensions, but I think we're usually storing them at 100x100. (The icon that shows up is actually 22x22, but going bigger makes them clearer on retina displays.)"
