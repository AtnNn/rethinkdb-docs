      "When you say \"connect the server back to the cluster to regain full health,\" what does this mean in terms of user action? Restarting the server with the `--join` option? And which server -- the one(s) with the replicas that aren't ready? What replication settings would need to be adjusted, the list of replicas in the `shard` key for a given table in `table_config`?\r\n\r\nSorry to ask questions about virtually every noun. :)"
