      "I left that out of the command syntax on purpose because it was so unusual, but adding it as an additional line is a good idea, so I'll do that.\r\n\r\nThe quotes were removed in review, because they seemed unnecessary in this instance. I don't think we generally show string options with \"quotes\" unless the option takes mixed values (if it can be something like `true`, `false` and `\"self-destruct\"`)."
