You can create feeds that subscribe to messages posted to a specific room:\r\n> ```\r\nr.table('messages').changes().filter(\r\n  r.row('new_val')('room_id').eq(ROOM_ID)\r\n).run(conn, callback)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that we support it, we should change that and the following example to have the `filter` in front of the `changes()`. That makes the query more efficient.\r\n"
