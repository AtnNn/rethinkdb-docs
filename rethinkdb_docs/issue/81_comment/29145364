      "@mglukhovsky which version of apache were you running?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Arch ships Apache 2.2, and all the modules needed here comes with the main package.\r\nWith Arch, the password files should be in `/etc/httpd/` (which is `/etc/apache2`/ with Ubuntu I think).\r\n\r\nAlso `a2enmod` doesn't exist on Arch (anymore?). It seems like CentOS doesn't have this command too."
