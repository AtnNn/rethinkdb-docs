        "The `configure` script attempts to detect Python (presumably by querying the `python` executable in `$PATH`) and will fail if it finds Python 3, as is the case by default under Arch Linux:\r\n\r\n> Error: python 3.4.2 is too recent. At most python 2.9.99 is required.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: [the ArchWiki article on Python](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Python#Dealing_with_version_problem_in_build_scripts) suggests installing some bash voodoo in `$PATH` in order to redirect specific scripts to `python2`. (I have not tested this).\r\n\r\nPossible resolution: `configure` should instead look for an executable named `python2`.\r\n\r\nProbable further bug: whatever `configure` wants Python 2 for may also be labouring under the assumption that `python` means Python 2."
