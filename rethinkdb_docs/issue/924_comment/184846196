      "Hmm missing optargs are a pretty significant limitation, because they make it impossible to use any secondary indexes for example (unless your driver already supports optargs in that particular case?).\r\nI think the other limitations are ok, but (at least the basic) optional argument should be supported for inclusion in the drivers list.\r\n\r\n@chipotle What do you think about changing the \"Older community-supported drivers\" section into a \"Community-supported drivers with limited features\" section?\r\nWe should also remove many drivers that are currently in there, because they are still based on protocol buffers and we don't support those anymore at all. Namely those would be the two Java drivers and the C driver. The other ones appear to be using the JSON protocol, and would fit into the \"limited feature drivers\" section."
