      "It does look reasonably complete to me. I noticed that geospatial terms are missing, and (possibly more importantly) `group`. That puts it a bit on the edge, but I think it's fine for being listed. Some of the other listed drivers aren't complete either.\r\n\r\nOne last question though @pixelspark : Can you pass optional arguments to terms such as `between`, `distinct` etc? I couldn't tell from a quick look at the code."
