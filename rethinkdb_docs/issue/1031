        "https://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/wait/ says that the default value for `waitFor` is `ready_for_writes`.\r\nI think this was what we intended at some point, but for reasons that I don't remember exactly we actually ended up with a default of `all_replicas_ready`. \r\n\r\nWe're probably going to change the server side default for 2.3, but for now we should make the documentation to align with 2.2.x behavior and mention the default as `all_replicas_ready`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5316 has more details"
