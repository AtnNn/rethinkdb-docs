However Compose now enables SSL access by default, which is usually more convenient to use.\r\n\r\nAlso the link to https://docs.compose.io/common-questions/how-to-connect-to-rethinkdb.html should be replaced by https://help.compose.io/docs/connecting-to-rethinkdb , which seems to be more up to date."
