      "Also, as an aside, I think there's some confusion about what this document is supposed to do.  Is this supposed to document ReQL as a protocol, or document how to translate between the protobuf format driver developers are currently using and the JSON protocol?  I wrote it to do the second; doing the first will produce a much longer document (since it will also have to include all the documentation in `ql2.proto`)."
