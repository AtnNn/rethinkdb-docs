      "@neumino -- sorry, I should have specified the context of this. @mlucy added a JSON spec file (which was reviewed separately and accepted), and I'm the messenger incorporating it into our docs/website. I agree with your comments, but I think we should do that separately.\r\n\r\nWould you mind if we merged it into the site, and then did a separate set of improvements? I opened an issue for that here -- #355."
