      "@chipotle you can do something like this in Python:\r\n```py\r\nimport rethinkdb as r\r\no = {}\r\no[\"e\"] = o\r\nr.expr(o)\r\n.... throws the mentioned RqlDriverError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think this is the typical case though. I agree that it's at least equally likely that users run into this because of objects or arrays that are simply deeply nested."
