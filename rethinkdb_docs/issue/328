        "In the ten minute guide (http://rethinkdb.com/docs/guide/javascript/), the guy on the couch is an *amazing* fit for what we're trying to convey (awesome illustration, @ahruygt ), but he's facing away from the code. We should mirror the image horizontally, that would make the illustration fit 10x better.\r\n\r\nI wanted to just do it and submit a PR, but then realized I can't just mirror the guy on the JS page since the label \"JS\" on his mug doesn't mirror well. @ahruygt -- could you make these changes and work with @chipotle to get them deployed?"
