        "RethinkDB 2.3.2 will have a new command line option `--cluster-reconnect-timeout`, added by @mbroadst via https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/5701 .\r\n\r\nIf a RethinkDB server A gets connected to a second server B (typically because one of them is passed the other's address the `--join` option) and then loses the connection, it will try to reconnect to server B periodically. If it cannot re-establish the connection for 24 hours, it gives up. The new `--cluster-reconnect-timeout` option controls this timeout. The option must be specified in seconds, with the default being `24*60*60`."
