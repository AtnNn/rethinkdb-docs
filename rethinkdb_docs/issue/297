        "- We should mention that only datum can be passed to `do` (and not selection)\r\n- `r.expr(1).do(function(var) { ... })` is also a valid syntax\r\n- arguments are synchronously evaluated -- @mlucy could you confirm that? The few tests are run seems to confirm it.\r\n\r\nBonus question: Should `r.do(r.expr(1))` throw? We currently don't."
