      "@neumino pointed me at the source code with the defaults. One other question: I'm assuming that in the JS driver these \"sub-optargs\" are *not* converted from camelCase, so you would write\r\n\r\n    run(conn, {batchConf: {max_batch_rows: 10}}\r\n\r\nrather than\r\n\r\n    run(conn, {batchConf: {maxBatchRows: 10}}\r\n\r\nIs that right?"
