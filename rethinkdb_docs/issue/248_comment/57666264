      "It looks like the default values ensure that the initial batch will be one row -- `max_batch_rows` and `first_batch_scaledown_factor` are both 8. If you adjust `max_batch_rows` is there guidance we should give on what to change the scaledown factor to? Is there really an advantage to making `first_batch_scaledown_factor` user-tunable, rather than just automatically setting it to be the same as `max_batch_rows`? And if so, would you ever want to set it to anything other than `max_batch_rows` or 1, which (I think) would make the first batch perform the same as the following batches?"
