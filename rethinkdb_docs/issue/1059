      Just
        "There are at least three parts to this:\r\n* Two new system tables \"users\" and \"permissions\" that need to be documented under http://rethinkdb.com/docs/system-tables/ . I think they probably should get their own subdocument.\r\n* A new `grant` command for the API\r\n* A conceptual overview of our permissions system. This should probably go into a new separate document that should also be mentioned on http://rethinkdb.com/docs/security/ \r\n\r\nWe also need to document how permissions interact with the existing system tables (see https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5463). If we add a separate \"Permissions & User Accounts\" document for point 3 above, then that would likely be the best place for putting this.\r\n\r\nThe issue about this in the rethinkdb repo is https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/4519 .\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll need to document the setup of protected clusters somewhere (https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5490). This still needs to be implemented. I think it could also go into the \"Permissions & User Accounts\" overview document.\r\n\r\nAssigning to myself as I want to provide some examples and details on the system tables and other aspects of the system. Will reassign to @chipotle later."
