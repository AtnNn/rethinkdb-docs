      "The JavaScript drivers currently translates some optargs from camel case to underscore (like `returnChanges` to `return_changes`.\r\n\r\nThe driver currently doesn't enforce the options provided for a command (we do enforce the options for `run` though).\r\nI'm not sure there is a clean way to do it as the part that builds the optargs is in `RDBOp`. We would have to move this in each command, which isn't hard but a bit annoying.\r\n\r\nPutting in backlog for now as it's not critical (both `return_changes` and `returnChanges` work).\r\nWe'll do it when we have a few minutes to spare."
