        "The best docs I found were on the \"securing your cluster\" page. I don't know if there's more comprehensive documentation on the auth key.\r\n\r\n__Tacking this on__:\r\nThe authentication docs are also misleading as to what protection the auth_key provides.\r\nIt should be really really clear that it provides no encryption whatsoever.\r\nIt is only helpful when:\r\n\r\n1. an attacker or co-user of one of your servers gains non-root access to a machine in your network. They typically won't be able to connect to the database then, and cannot sniff the auth key from the network.\r\n2.  In a network where you are sure that clients only connect through paths that cannot be intercepted, but you don't want to set up a firewall to restrict access to the client port from the outside.\r\n\r\nThere should probably be an admonition to not use the auth_key without SSL or SSH tunnelling set up."
