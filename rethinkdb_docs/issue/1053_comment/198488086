      "I think this needs a bit of extra explanation:\r\n`eqJoin` was never fully ordered in its result. However it used to guarantee that its output was ordered based on the (left) input stream.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```js\r\nr.expr([{foreignKey: 1}, {foreignKey: 2}].eqJoin(\"foreignKey\", r.table(\"other\"))\r\n```\r\nwas guarantees to first emit joined documents from `other` that matched `{foreignKey: 1}`, followed by all documents from `other` that matched the key `{foreignKey: 2}`.\r\nIf the join had been on a secondary index, and there were multiple matches for e.g. key `1`, the order of those matches compared to each other was never guaranteed. However you would never see a match for key `2` before seeing all matches for key `1`.\r\n\r\nIn 2.3, this no longer holds, and results can be in any order whatsoever. The new optarg `{ordered: true|false}` restores the old behavior when set to `true`. By default it is `false`.\r\n\r\n"
