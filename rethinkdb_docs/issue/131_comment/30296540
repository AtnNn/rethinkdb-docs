      "Awesome set of fixes, @Tryneus, superb pull request. My only question is whether we should indeed have the alternate operators (e.g. `!=` and `ne`) both mentioned in the titles of the commands -- this is a question of existing style. I personally think it's an improvement, but I want to ensure we're consistent across languages.\r\n\r\n@neumino, could you review this as well, since there are a lot of changes?"
