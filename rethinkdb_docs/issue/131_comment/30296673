      "@mglukhovsky, I considered it an issue of discovery.  If someone is writing queries, there is nothing right now to indicate it is even possible to use `.ne`, for example.  Furthermore, if someone is reading old code and runs across a `.ne`, this diff will make it much easier to find the documentation for it."
