      "@dalanmiller I think as long as it's required on at least some ARM platforms, this is better than not adding it. If we introduced some new ARM-specific problem that was revealed in a compiler warning, this increases the chance that we're going to miss it because users probably won't report it. However that's better than having a compilation guide up that doesn't work for a lot of users I think.\r\n\r\nOnce we've addressed all current issues that cause warnings on some ARM platforms, we can remove the `ALLOW_WARNINGS=1` again."
