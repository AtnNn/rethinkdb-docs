      "`mg_preview` doesn't contain anything more than `master` to build the docs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo currently start Jekyll based on the docs repository only, we need:\r\n- Include a config file to tell Jekyll to use Redcarpet + tables\r\n- Copy _includes/recipe-forms.html from www to docs\r\n- Copy the plugins\r\n\r\nThen Jekyll start without complaining but:\r\n- The links to images are broken\r\n- It doesn't come with a template\r\n\r\n\r\nFixing the images would require to properly create a assert/images directory I think.\r\nAdding a template, css etc. should be doable I think.\r\n\r\n\r\n@metaflow -- do you want to have the docs offline? Or is it to be able to send nice pull requests?"
