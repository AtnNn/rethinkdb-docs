        "I was following the installation instructions on a brand new Raspbian and got stuck with this error:\r\n```fatal error: openssl/sha.h: No such file or directory```\r\n\r\nTurns out, I just had to install another dependency:\r\n```sudo apt-get install libssl-dev```\r\n\r\nOT: I was able to successfully install rethinkdb after that. The compilation process took **several** hours on the latest Raspberry PI 3 model, I don't know if this is something we should mention in the docs."
