      "Well, we have two examples already, including one sort of like that:\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nr.table('players').get('f19b5f16-ef14-468f-bd48-e194761df255').do { |player|\r\n    player['gross_score'] - player['course_handicap']\r\n}.run(conn)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure what to in the context of #620 -- the examples we have involve using the results of queries in the function and doing branching. Maybe there's a more complex example that we could come up with, but there's only one example using `do` in the cookbook I could find and while the *overall* example is complex, the function being passed to `do` is still fairly straightforward."
