        "Checking out the [examples page](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/examples/) and realised that the links to mollyjs.com are broken and site seems to be down.\r\n\r\nWas going to just remove the example from the docs and submit a pull, but thought I'd raise this first in case there was a way of getting the link working again. I've [raised an issue on the Mollyjs repo](https://github.com/psb/molly.js/issues/1) to try and get it going again.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? It strikes me a great demo, so it might be worth making at attempt at getting it going again before removing it."
